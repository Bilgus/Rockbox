"#Chapter 21: Light Up "
"\n"
"You have a grid of squares. Some are filled in black; some of the "
"black squares are numbered. Your aim is to `light up' all the empty "
"squares by placing light bulbs in some of them. "
"\n"
"Each light bulb illuminates the square it is on, plus all squares "
"in line with it horizontally or vertically unless a black square is "
"blocking the way. "
"\n"
"To win the game, you must satisfy the following conditions: "
"\n"
"- All non-black squares are lit. "
"\n"
"- No light is lit by another light. "
"\n"
"- All numbered black squares have exactly that number of lights "
"adjacent to them (in the four squares above, below, and to the "
"side). "
"\n"
"Non-numbered black squares may have any number of lights adjacent to "
"them. "
"\n"
"Credit for this puzzle goes to Nikoli [9]. "
"\n"
"Light Up was contributed to this collection by James Harvey. "

"\n#21.1 Light Up controls "
"\n"
"Left-clicking in a non-black square will toggle the presence of a "
"light in that square. Right-clicking in a non-black square toggles a "
"mark there to aid solving; it can be used to highlight squares that "
"cannot be lit, for example. "
"\n"
"You may not place a light in a marked square, nor place a mark in a "
"lit square. "
"\n"
"The game will highlight obvious errors in red. Lights lit by other "
"lights are highlighted in this way, as are numbered squares which do "
"not (or cannot) have the right number of lights next to them. "
"\n"
"Thus, the grid is solved when all non-black squares have yellow "
"highlights and there are no red lights. "
"\n"
"(All the actions described in section 2.1 are also available.) "
"\n"
"\n#21.2 Light Up parameters "
"\n"
"These parameters are available from the `Custom...' option on the "
"`Type' menu. "
"\n"
"_Width_, _Height_ "
"\n"
"Size of grid in squares. "
"\n"
"_%age of black squares_ "
"\n"
"Rough percentage of black squares in the grid. "
"\n"
"This is a hint rather than an instruction. If the grid generator "
"is unable to generate a puzzle to this precise specification, it "
"will increase the proportion of black squares until it can. "
"\n"
"_Symmetry_ "
"\n"
"Allows you to specify the required symmetry of the black squares "
"in the grid. (This does not affect the difficulty of the puzzles "
"noticeably.) "
"\n"
"_Difficulty_ "
"\n"
"`Easy' means that the puzzles should be soluble without "
"backtracking or guessing, `Hard' means that some guesses will "
"probably be necessary. "
