"\n"
"You are given a grid of dots, marked with yellow lines to indicate "
"which dots you are allowed to connect directly together. Your aim is "
"to use some subset of those yellow lines to draw a single unbroken "
"loop from dot to dot within the grid. "
"\n"
"Some of the spaces between the lines contain numbers. These numbers "
"indicate how many of the lines around that space form part of the "
"loop. The loop you draw must correctly satisfy all of these clues to "
"be considered a correct solution. "
"\n"
"In the default mode, the dots are arranged in a grid of squares; "
"however, you can also play on triangular or hexagonal grids, or even "
"more exotic ones. "
"\n"
"Credit for the basic puzzle idea goes to Nikoli [10]. "
"\n"
"Loopy was originally contributed to this collection by Mike Pinna, "
"and subsequently enhanced to handle various types of non-square grid "
"by Lambros Lambrou. "

"\n#23.1 Loopy controls "
"\n"
"Click the left mouse button on a yellow line to turn it black, "
"indicating that you think it is part of the loop. Click again to "
"turn the line yellow again (meaning you aren't sure yet). "
"\n"
"If you are sure that a particular line segment is _not_ part of the "
"loop, you can click the right mouse button to remove it completely. "
"Again, clicking a second time will turn the line back to yellow. "
"\n"
"(All the actions described in section 2.1 are also available.) "

"\n#23.2 Loopy parameters "
"\n"
"These parameters are available from the `Custom...' option on the "
"`Type' menu. "
"\n"
"_Width_, _Height_ "
"\n"
"Size of grid, measured in number of regions across and down. For "
"square grids, it's clear how this is counted; for other types of "
"grid you may have to think a bit to see how the dimensions are "
"measured. "
"\n"
"_Grid type_ "
"\n"
"Allows you to choose between a selection of types of tiling. "
"Some have all the faces the same but may have multiple different "
"types of vertex (e.g. the _Cairo_ or _Kites_ mode); others "
"have all the vertices the same but may have different types of "
"face (e.g. the _Great Hexagonal_). The square, triangular and "
"honeycomb grids are fully regular, and have all their vertices "
"_and_ faces the same; this makes them the least confusing to "
"play. "
"\n"
"_Difficulty_ "
"\n"
"Controls the difficulty of the generated puzzle. "
