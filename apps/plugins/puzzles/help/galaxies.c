"You have a rectangular grid containing a number of dots. Your aim is "
"to draw edges along the grid lines which divide the rectangle into "
"regions in such a way that every region is 180-degree rotationally "
"symmetric, and contains exactly one dot which is located at its "
"centre of symmetry. "
"\n"
"This puzzle was invented by Nikoli [13], under the name `Tentai "
"Show'; its name is commonly translated into English as `Spiral "
"Galaxies'. "
"\n"
"Galaxies was contributed to this collection by James Harvey. "

"\n#28.1 Galaxies controls "
"\n"
"Left-click on any grid line to draw an edge if there isn't one "
"already, or to remove one if there is. When you create a valid "
"region (one which is closed, contains exactly one dot, is 180-degree "
"symmetric about that dot, and contains no extraneous edges inside "
"it) it will be highlighted automatically; so your aim is to have the "
"whole grid highlighted in that way. "
"\n"
"During solving, you might know that a particular grid square belongs "
"to a specific dot, but not be sure of where the edges go and which "
"other squares are connected to the dot. In order to mark this so you "
"don't forget, you can right-click on the dot and drag, which will "
"create an arrow marker pointing at the dot. Drop that in a square of "
"your choice and it will remind you which dot it's associated with. "
"You can also right-click on existing arrows to pick them up and move "
"them, or destroy them by dropping them off the edge of the grid. "
"(Also, if you're not sure which dot an arrow is pointing at, you can "
"pick it up and move it around to make it clearer. It will swivel "
"constantly as you drag it, to stay pointed at its parent dot.) "
"\n"
"You can also use the cursor keys to move around the grid squares and "
"lines. Pressing the return key when over a grid line will draw or "
"clear its edge, as above. Pressing the return key when over a dot "
"will pick up an arrow, to be dropped the next time the return key "
"is pressed; this can also be used to move existing arrows around, "
"removing them by dropping them on a dot or another arrow. "
"\n"
"(All the actions described in section 2.1 are also available.) "
