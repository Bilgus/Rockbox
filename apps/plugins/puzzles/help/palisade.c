"You're given a grid of squares, some of which contain numbers. Your "
"goal is to subdivide the grid into contiguous regions, all of the "
"same (given) size, such that each square containing a number is "
"adjacent to exactly that many edges (including those between the "
"inside and the outside of the grid). "

"Credit for this puzzle goes to Nikoli, who call it `Five Cells'. "

"arrowkey to switch off an edge. Repeat an action to perform its "
"inverse. "
