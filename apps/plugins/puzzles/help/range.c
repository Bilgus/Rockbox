"You have a grid of squares; some squares contain numbers. Your job "
"is to colour some of the squares black, such that several criteria "
"are satisfied: "
"\n"
"- no square with a number is coloured black. "
"\n"
"- no two black squares are adjacent (horizontally or vertically). "
"\n"
"- for any two white squares, there is a path between them using "
"only white squares. "
"\n"
"- for each square with a number, that number denotes the total "
"number of white squares reachable from that square going in a "
"straight line in any horizontal or vertical direction until "
"hitting a wall or a black square; the square with the number is "
"included in the total (once). "
"\n"
"For instance, a square containing the number one must have four "
"black squares as its neighbours by the last criterion; but then it's "
"impossible for it to be connected to any outside white square, which "
"violates the second to last criterion. So no square will contain the "
"number one. "

"\n#35.1 Range controls "
"\n"
"Click with the left button to paint a square black, or with the "
"right button to mark a square with a dot to indicate that you are "
"sure it should _not_ be painted black. Repeated clicking with either "
"button will cycle the square through the three possible states "
"(filled, dotted or empty) in opposite directions. "
"\n"
"You can also use the cursor keys to move around the grid squares. "
"Pressing Return does the same as clicking with the left button, "
"while pressing Space does the same as a right button click. Moving "
"with the cursor keys while holding Shift will place dots in all "
"squares that are moved through. "
"\n"
"(All the actions described in section 2.1 are also available.) "
