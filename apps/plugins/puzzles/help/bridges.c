"#Chapter 26: Bridges "
"\n"
"You have a set of islands distributed across the playing area. "
"Each island contains a number. Your aim is to connect the islands "
"together with bridges, in such a way that: "
"\n"
"- Bridges run horizontally or vertically. "
"\n"
"- The number of bridges terminating at any island is equal to the "
"number written in that island. "
"\n"
"- Two bridges may run in parallel between the same two islands, "
"but no more than two may do so. "
"\n"
"- No bridge crosses another bridge. "
"\n"
"- All the islands are connected together. "
"\n"
"There are some configurable alternative modes, which involve "
"changing the parallel-bridge limit to something other than 2, and "
"introducing the additional constraint that no sequence of bridges "
"may form a loop from one island back to the same island. The rules "
"stated above are the default ones. "
"\n"
"Credit for this puzzle goes to Nikoli [12]. "

"\n#26.1 Bridges controls "
"\n"
"To place a bridge between two islands, click the mouse down on one "
"island and drag it towards the other. You do not need to drag all "
"the way to the other island; you only need to move the mouse far "
"enough for the intended bridge direction to be unambiguous. (So you "
"can keep the mouse near the starting island and conveniently throw "
"bridges out from it in many directions.) "
"\n"
"Doing this again when a bridge is already present will add another "
"parallel bridge. If there are already as many bridges between the "
"two islands as permitted by the current game rules (i.e. two by "
"default), the same dragging action will remove all of them. "
"\n"
"If you want to remind yourself that two islands definitely _do not_ "
"have a bridge between them, you can right-drag between them in the "
"same way to draw a `non-bridge' marker. "
"\n"
"If you think you have finished with an island (i.e. you have placed "
"all its bridges and are confident that they are in the right "
"places), you can mark the island as finished by left-clicking on it. "
"This will highlight it and all the bridges connected to it, and you "
"will be prevented from accidentally modifying any of those bridges "
"in future. Left-clicking again on a highlighted island will unmark "
"it and restore your ability to modify it. "
"\n"
"You can also use the cursor keys to move around the grid: if "
"possible the cursor will always move orthogonally, otherwise it "
"will move towards the nearest island to the indicated direction. "
"Holding Control and pressing a cursor key will lay a bridge in that "
"direction (if available); Shift and a cursor key will lay a `non-\n"
"bridge' marker. Pressing the return key followed by a cursor key "
"will also lay a bridge in that direction. "
"\n"
"You can mark an island as finished by pressing the space bar or by "
"pressing the return key twice. "
"\n"
"By pressing a number key, you can jump to the nearest island with "
"that number. Letters `a', ..., `f' count as 10, ..., 15 and `0' as "
"16. "
"\n"
"Violations of the puzzle rules will be marked in red: "
"\n"
"- An island with too many bridges will be highlighted in red. "
"\n"
"- An island with too few bridges will be highlighted in red if it "
"is definitely an error (as opposed to merely not being finished "
"yet): if adding enough bridges would involve having to cross "
"another bridge or remove a non-bridge marker, or if the island "
"has been highlighted as complete. "
"\n"
"- A group of islands and bridges may be highlighted in red if it "
"is a closed subset of the puzzle with no way to connect it to "
"the rest of the islands. For example, if you directly connect "
"two 1s together with a bridge and they are not the only two "
"islands on the grid, they will light up red to indicate that "
"such a group cannot be contained in any valid solution. "
"\n"
"- If you have selected the (non-default) option to disallow loops "
"in the solution, a group of bridges which forms a loop will be "
"highlighted. "
"\n"
"(All the actions described in section 2.1 are also available.) "

"\n#26.2 Bridges parameters "
"\n"
"These parameters are available from the `Custom...' option on the "
"`Type' menu. "
"\n"
"_Width_, _Height_ "
"\n"
"Size of grid in squares. "
"\n"
"_Difficulty_ "
"\n"
"Difficulty level of puzzle. "
"\n"
"_Allow loops_ "
"\n"
"This is set by default. If cleared, puzzles will be generated in "
"such a way that they are always soluble without creating a loop, "
"and solutions which do involve a loop will be disallowed. "
"\n"
"_Max. bridges per direction_ "
"\n"
"Maximum number of bridges in any particular direction. The "
"default is 2, but you can change it to 1, 3 or 4. In general, "
"fewer is easier. "
"\n"
"_%age of island squares_ "
"\n"
"Gives a rough percentage of islands the generator will try and "
"lay before finishing the puzzle. Certain layouts will not manage "
"to lay enough islands; this is an upper bound. "
"\n"
"_Expansion factor (%age)_ "
"\n"
"The grid generator works by picking an existing island at random "
"(after first creating an initial island somewhere). It then "
"decides on a direction (at random), and then works out how far "
"it could extend before creating another island. This parameter "
"determines how likely it is to extend as far as it can, rather "
"than choosing somewhere closer. "
"\n"
"High expansion factors usually mean easier puzzles with fewer "
"possible islands; low expansion factors can create lots of "
"tightly-packed islands. "
