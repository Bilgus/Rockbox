"#Chapter 40: Tracks "
"\n"
"You are given a grid of squares, some of which are filled with train "
"tracks. You need to complete the track from A to B so that the "
"rows and columns contain the same number of track segments as are "
"indicated in the clues to the top and right of the grid. "
"\n"
"There are only straight and 90 degree curved rails, and the track "
"may not cross itself. "
"\n"
"Tracks was contributed to this collection by James Harvey. "
"\n"
"\n#40.1 Tracks controls "
"\n"
"Left-clicking on an edge between two squares adds a track segment "
"between the two squares. Right-clicking on an edge adds a cross on "
"the edge, indicating no track is possible there. "
"\n"
"Left-clicking in a square adds a colour indicator showing that "
"you know the square must contain a track, even if you don't know "
"which edges it crosses yet. Right-clicking in a square adds a cross "
"indicating it contains no track segment. "
"\n"
"Left- or right-dragging between squares allows you to lay a straight "
"line of is-track or is-not-track indicators, useful for filling in "
"rows or columns to match the clue. "
"\n"
"(All the actions described in section 2.1 are also available.) "
"\n"
"\n#40.2 Tracks parameters "
"\n"
"These parameters are available from the `Custom...' option on the "
"`Type' menu. "

"_Width_, _Height_ "
"\n"
"Size of the grid, in squares. "
"\n"
"_Difficulty_ "
"\n"
"Controls the difficulty of the generated puzzle: at Tricky "
"level, you are required to make more deductions regarding "
"disregarding moves that would lead to impossible crossings "
"later. "
"\n"
"_Disallow consecutive 1 clues_ "
"\n"
"Controls whether the Tracks game generation permits two adjacent "
"rows or columns to have a 1 clue, or permits the row or column "
"of the track's endpoint to have a 1 clue. By default this is "
"not permitted, to avoid long straight boring segments of track "
"and make the games more twiddly and interesting. If you want to "
"restore the possibility, turn this option off. "
