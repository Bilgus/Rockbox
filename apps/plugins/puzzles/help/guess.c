"#Chapter 15: Guess "
"\n"
"You have a set of coloured pegs, and have to reproduce a "
"predetermined sequence of them (chosen by the computer) within a "
"certain number of guesses. "
"\n"
"Each guess gets marked with the number of correctly-coloured pegs "
"in the correct places (in black), and also the number of correctly-\n"
"coloured pegs in the wrong places (in white). "
"\n"
"This game is also known (and marketed, by Hasbro, mainly) as a board "
"game `Mastermind', with 6 colours, 4 pegs per row, and 10 guesses. "
"However, this version allows custom settings of number of colours "
"(up to 10), number of pegs per row, and number of guesses. "
"\n"
"Guess was contributed to this collection by James Harvey. "
"\n"
"\n#15.1 Guess controls "
"\n"
"This game can be played with either the keyboard or the mouse. "
"\n"
"With the mouse, drag a coloured peg from the tray on the left-hand "
"side to its required position in the current guess; pegs may also "
"be dragged from current and past guesses to copy them elsewhere. To "
"remove a peg, drag it off its current position to somewhere invalid. "
"\n"
"Right-clicking in the current guess adds a `hold' marker; pegs that "
"have hold markers will be automatically added to the next guess "
"after marking. "
"\n"
"Alternatively, with the keyboard, the up and down cursor keys can "
"be used to select a peg colour, the left and right keys to select a "
"peg position, and the space bar or Enter key to place a peg of the "
"selected colour in the chosen position. `D' or Backspace removes a "
"peg, and Space adds a hold marker. "
"\n"
"Pressing `h' or `?' will fill the current guess with a suggested "
"guess. Using this is not recommended for 10 or more pegs as it is "
"slow. "
"\n"
"When the guess is complete, the smaller feedback pegs will be "
"highlighted; clicking on these (or moving the peg cursor to them "
"with the arrow keys and pressing the space bar or Enter key) will "
"mark the current guess, copy any held pegs to the next guess, and "
"move the `current guess' marker. "
"\n"
"If you correctly position all the pegs the solution will be "
"displayed below; if you run out of guesses (or select `Solve...') "
"the solution will also be revealed. "
"\n"
"(All the actions described in section 2.1 are also available.) "
"\n"
"\n#15.2 Guess parameters "
"\n"
"These parameters are available from the `Custom...' option on the "
"`Type' menu. The default game matches the parameters for the board "
"game `Mastermind'. "
"\n"
"_Colours_ "
"\n"
"Number of colours the solution is chosen from; from 2 to 10 "
"(more is harder). "
"\n"
"_Pegs per guess_ "
"\n"
"Number of pegs per guess (more is harder). "
"\n"
"_Guesses_ "
"\n"
"Number of guesses you have to find the solution in (fewer is "
"harder). "
"\n"
"_Allow blanks_ "
"\n"
"Allows blank pegs to be given as part of a guess (makes it "
"easier, because you know that those will never be counted as "
"part of the solution). This is turned off by default. "
"\n"
"Note that this doesn't allow blank pegs in the solution; if you "
"really wanted that, use one extra colour. "
"\n"
"_Allow duplicates_ "
"\n"
"Allows the solution (and the guesses) to contain colours more "
"than once; this increases the search space (making things "
"harder), and is turned on by default. "
"\n"
