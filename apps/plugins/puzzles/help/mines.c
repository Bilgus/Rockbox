"#Chapter 12: Mines "
"\n"
"You have a grid of covered squares, some of which contain mines, but "
"you don't know which. Your job is to uncover every square which does "
"_not_ contain a mine. If you uncover a square containing a mine, you "
"lose. If you uncover a square which does not contain a mine, you "
"are told how many mines are contained within the eight surrounding "
"squares. "
"\n"
"This game needs no introduction; popularised by Windows, it is "
"perhaps the single best known desktop puzzle game in existence. "
"\n"
"This version of it has an unusual property. By default, it will "
"generate its mine positions in such a way as to ensure that you "
"never need to _guess_ where a mine is: you will always be able "
"to deduce it somehow. So you will never, as can happen in other "
"versions, get to the last four squares and discover that there are "
"two mines left but you have no way of knowing for sure where they "
"are. "
"\n"
"\n#12.1 Mines controls "
"\n"
"This game is played with the mouse. "
"\n"
"If you left-click in a covered square, it will be uncovered. "
"\n"
"If you right-click in a covered square, it will place a flag which "
"indicates that the square is believed to be a mine. Left-clicking in "
"a marked square will not uncover it, for safety. You can right-click "
"again to remove a mark placed in error. "
"\n"
"If you left-click in an _uncovered_ square, it will `clear around' "
"the square. This means: if the square has exactly as many flags "
"surrounding it as it should have mines, then all the covered squares "
"next to it which are _not_ flagged will be uncovered. So once you "
"think you know the location of all the mines around a square, you "
"can use this function as a shortcut to avoid having to click on each "
"of the remaining squares one by one. "
"\n"
"If you uncover a square which has _no_ mines in the surrounding "
"eight squares, then it is obviously safe to uncover those squares in "
"turn, and so on if any of them also has no surrounding mines. This "
"will be done for you automatically; so sometimes when you uncover a "
"square, a whole new area will open up to be explored. "
"\n"
"You can also use the cursor keys to move around the minefield. "
"Pressing the return key in a covered square uncovers it, and in "
"an uncovered square will clear around it (so it acts as the left "
"button), pressing the space bar in a covered square will place a "
"flag (similarly, it acts as the right button). "
"\n"
"All the actions described in section 2.1 are also available. "
"\n"
"Even Undo is available, although you might consider it cheating to "
"use it. If you step on a mine, the program will only reveal the mine "
"in question (unlike most other implementations, which reveal all of "
"them). You can then Undo your fatal move and continue playing if you "
"like. The program will track the number of times you died (and Undo "
"will not reduce that counter), so when you get to the end of the "
"game you know whether or not you did it without making any errors. "
"\n"
"(If you really want to know the full layout of the grid, which other "
"implementations will show you after you die, you can always use the "
"Solve menu option.) "
"\n"
"\n#12.2 Mines parameters "
"\n"
"The options available from the `Custom...' option on the `Type' menu "
"are: "
"\n"
"_Width_, _Height_ "
"\n"
"Size of grid in squares. "
"\n"
"_Mines_ "
"\n"
"Number of mines in the grid. You can enter this as an absolute "
"mine count, or alternatively you can put a % sign on the end "
"in which case the game will arrange for that proportion of the "
"squares in the grid to be mines. "
"\n"
"Beware of setting the mine count too high. At very high "
"densities, the program may spend forever searching for a "
"solvable grid. "
"\n"
"_Ensure solubility_ "
"\n"
"When this option is enabled (as it is by default), Mines will "
"ensure that the entire grid can be fully deduced starting "
"from the initial open space. If you prefer the riskier grids "
"generated by other implementations, you can switch off this "
"option. "
