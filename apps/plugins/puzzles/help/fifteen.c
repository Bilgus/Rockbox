"\n"
"The old ones are the best: this is the good old `15-puzzle' with "
"sliding tiles. You have a 4x4 square grid; 15 squares contain "
"numbered tiles, and the sixteenth is empty. Your move is to choose a "
"tile next to the empty space, and slide it into the space. The aim "
"is to end up with the tiles in numerical order, with the space in "
"the bottom right (so that the top row reads 1,2,3,4 and the bottom "
"row reads 13,14,15,_space_). "
"\n"
"\n#5.1 Fifteen controls "
"\n"
"This game can be controlled with the mouse or the keyboard. "
"\n"
"A left-click with the mouse in the row or column containing the "
"empty space will move as many tiles as necessary to move the space "
"to the mouse pointer. "
"\n"
"The arrow keys will move a tile adjacent to the space in the "
"direction indicated (moving the space in the _opposite_ direction). "
"\n"
"Pressing `h' will make a suggested move. Pressing `h' enough times "
"will solve the game, but it may scramble your progress while doing "
"so. "
"\n"
"(All the actions described in section 2.1 are also available.) "
"\n"
"\n#5.2 Fifteen parameters "
"\n"
"The only options available from the `Custom...' option on the `Type' "
"menu are _Width_ and _Height_, which are self-explanatory. (Once "
"you've changed these, it's not a `15-puzzle' any more, of course!) "
