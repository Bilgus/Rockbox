"#Chapter 29: Filling "
"\n"
"You have a grid of squares, some of which contain digits, and the "
"rest of which are empty. Your job is to fill in digits in the empty "
"squares, in such a way that each connected region of squares all "
"containing the same digit has an area equal to that digit. "
"\n"
"(`Connected region', for the purposes of this game, does not count "
"diagonally separated squares as adjacent.) "
"\n"
"For example, it follows that no square can contain a zero, and that "
"two adjacent squares can not both contain a one. No region has an "
"area greater than 9 (because then its area would not be a single "
"digit). "

"Credit for this puzzle goes to Nikoli [14]. "

"\n#29.1 Filling controls "
"\n"
"To play Filling, simply click the mouse in any empty square and "
"then type a digit on the keyboard to fill that square. By dragging "
"the mouse, you can select multiple squares to fill with a single "
"keypress. If you make a mistake, click the mouse in the incorrect "
"square and press 0, Space, Backspace or Enter to clear it again (or "
"use the Undo feature). "
"\n"
"You can also move around the grid with the cursor keys; typing a "
"digit will fill the square containing the cursor with that number; "
"typing 0 will clear it. You can also select multiple squares for "
"numbering or clearing with the return and arrow keys, before typing "
"a digit to fill or clear the highlighted squares (as above). The "
"space bar adds and removes single squares to and from the selection. "
"Backspace and escape remove all squares from the selection. "
"\n"
"(All the actions described in section 2.1 are also available.) "

"\n#29.2 Filling parameters "
"\n"
"Filling allows you to configure the number of rows and columns of "
"the grid, through the `Type' menu. "
