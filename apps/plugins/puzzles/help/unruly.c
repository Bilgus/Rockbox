"You are given a grid of squares, which you must colour either black "
"or white. Some squares are provided as clues; the rest are left for "
"you to fill in. Each row and column must contain the same number "
"of black and white squares, and no row or column may contain three "
"consecutive squares of the same colour. "
"\n"
"This puzzle type was invented by Adolfo Zanellati, under the name "
"`Tohu wa Vohu'. See [21] for more details. "
"\n"
"Unruly was contributed to this collection by Lennard Sprong. "

"\n#38.1 Unruly controls "
"\n"
"To play Unruly, click the mouse in a square to change its colour. "
"Left-clicking an empty square will turn it black, and right-clicking "
"will turn it white. Keep clicking the same button to cycle through "
"the three possible states for the square. If you middle-click in a "
"square it will be reset to empty. "
"\n"
"You can also use the cursor keys to move around the grid. Pressing "
"the return or space keys will turn an empty square black or white "
"respectively (and then cycle the colours in the same way as the "
"mouse buttons), and pressing Backspace will reset a square to empty. "
"\n"
"(All the actions described in section 2.1 are also available.) "
