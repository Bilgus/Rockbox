"You have a grid of white squares, all of which contain numbers. Your "
"task is to colour some of the squares black (removing the number) so "
"as to satisfy all of the following conditions: "
"\n"
"- No number occurs more than once in any row or column. "
"\n"
"- No black square is horizontally or vertically adjacent to any "
"other black square. "
"\n"
"- The remaining white squares must all form one contiguous region "
"(connected by edges, not just touching at corners). "

"Left-clicking on an empty square will colour it black; left-clicking "
"again will restore the number. Right-clicking will add a circle "
"(useful for indicating that a cell is definitely not black). "
"\n"
"You can also use the cursor keys to move around the grid. Pressing "
"the return or space keys will turn a square black or add a circle "
"respectively, and pressing the key again will restore the number or "
"remove the circle. "
