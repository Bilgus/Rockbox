"#Chapter 31: Towers "
"\n"
"You have a square grid. On each square of the grid you can build "
"a tower, with its height ranging from 1 to the size of the grid. "
"Around the edge of the grid are some numeric clues. "
"\n"
"Your task is to build a tower on every square, in such a way that: "
"\n"
"- Each row contains every possible height of tower once "
"\n"
"- Each column contains every possible height of tower once "
"\n"
"- Each numeric clue describes the number of towers that can be "
"seen if you look into the square from that direction, assuming "
"that shorter towers are hidden behind taller ones. For example, "
"in a 5x5 grid, a clue marked `5' indicates that the five tower "
"heights must appear in increasing order (otherwise you would "
"not be able to see all five towers), whereas a clue marked `1' "
"indicates that the tallest tower (the one marked 5) must come "
"first. "
"\n"
"In harder or larger puzzles, some towers will be specified for you "
"as well as the clues round the edge, and some edge clues may be "
"missing. "
"\n"
"This puzzle appears on the web under various names, particularly "
"`Skyscrapers', but I don't know who first invented it. "
"\n"
"\n#31.1 Towers controls "
"\n"
"Towers shares much of its control system with Solo, Unequal and "
"Keen. "
"\n"
"To play Towers, simply click the mouse in any empty square and then "
"type a digit on the keyboard to fill that square with a tower of "
"the given height. If you make a mistake, click the mouse in the "
"incorrect square and press Space to clear it again (or use the Undo "
"feature). "
"\n"
"If you _right_-click in a square and then type a number, that "
"number will be entered in the square as a `pencil mark'. You can "
"have pencil marks for multiple numbers in the same square. A square "
"containing a tower cannot also contain pencil marks. "
"\n"
"The game pays no attention to pencil marks, so exactly what you "
"use them for is up to you: you can use them as reminders that a "
"particular square needs to be re-examined once you know more about "
"a particular number, or you can use them as lists of the possible "
"numbers in a given square, or anything else you feel like. "
"\n"
"To erase a single pencil mark, right-click in the square and type "
"the same number again. "
"\n"
"All pencil marks in a square are erased when you left-click and type "
"a number, or when you left-click and press space. Right-clicking and "
"pressing space will also erase pencil marks. "
"\n"
"As for Solo, the cursor keys can be used in conjunction with the "
"digit keys to set numbers or pencil marks. Use the cursor keys to "
"move a highlight around the grid, and type a digit to enter it in "
"the highlighted square. Pressing return toggles the highlight into a "
"mode in which you can enter or remove pencil marks. "
"\n"
"Pressing M will fill in a full set of pencil marks in every square "
"that does not have a main digit in it. "
"\n"
"Left-clicking a clue will mark it as done (grey it out), or unmark "
"it if it is already marked. Holding Control or Shift and pressing an "
"arrow key likewise marks any clue in the given direction. "
"\n"
"(All the actions described in section 2.1 are also available.) "
"\n"
"\n#31.2 Towers parameters "
"\n"
"These parameters are available from the `Custom...' option on the "
"`Type' menu. "
"\n"
"_Grid size_ "
"\n"
"Specifies the size of the grid. Lower limit is 3; upper limit is "
"9 (because the user interface would become more difficult with "
"`digits' bigger than 9!). "
"\n"
"_Difficulty_ "
"\n"
"Controls the difficulty of the generated puzzle. At Unreasonable "
"level, some backtracking will be required, but the solution "
"should still be unique. The remaining levels require "
"increasingly complex reasoning to avoid having to backtrack. "
