"\n"
"A number of balls are hidden in a rectangular arena. You have to "
"deduce the positions of the balls by firing lasers positioned at the "
"edges of the arena and observing how their beams are deflected. "
"\n"
"Beams will travel straight from their origin until they hit the "
"opposite side of the arena (at which point they emerge), unless "
"affected by balls in one of the following ways: "
"\n"
"- A beam that hits a ball head-on is absorbed and will never re-\n"
"emerge. This includes beams that meet a ball on the first rank "
"of the arena. "
"\n"
"- A beam with a ball in its front-left square and no ball ahead of "
"it gets deflected 90 degrees to the right. "
"\n"
"- A beam with a ball in its front-right square and no ball ahead "
"of it gets similarly deflected to the left. "
"\n"
"- A beam that would re-emerge from its entry location is "
"considered to be `reflected'. "
"\n"
"- A beam which would get deflected before entering the arena by a "
"ball to the front-left or front-right of its entry point is also "
"considered to be `reflected'. "
"\n"
"Beams that are reflected appear as a `R'; beams that hit balls head-\n"
"on appear as `H'. Otherwise, a number appears at the firing point "
"and the location where the beam emerges (this number is unique to "
"that shot). "
"\n"
"You can place guesses as to the location of the balls, based on the "
"entry and exit patterns of the beams; once you have placed enough "
"balls a button appears enabling you to have your guesses checked. "
"\n"
"Here is a diagram showing how the positions of balls can create each "
"of the beam behaviours shown above: "
"\n"
"1RHR----\n"
"|..O.O...|\n"
"2........3\n"
"|........|\n"
"|........|\n"
"3........|\n"
"|......O.|\n"
"H........|\n"
"|.....O..|\n"
"12-RR---\n"
"\n"
"As shown, it is possible for a beam to receive multiple reflections "
"before re-emerging (see turn 3). Similarly, a beam may be reflected "
"(possibly more than once) before receiving a hit (the `H' on the "
"left side of the example). "
"\n"
"Note that any layout with more than 4 balls may have a non-unique "
"solution. The following diagram illustrates this; if you know the "
"board contains 5 balls, it is impossible to determine where the "
"fifth ball is (possible positions marked with an x): "
"\n"
"--------\n"
"|........|\n"
"|........|\n"
"|..O..O..|\n"
"|...xx...|\n"
"|...xx...|\n"
"|..O..O..|\n"
"|........|\n"
"|........|\n"
"--------\n"
"\n"
"For this reason, when you have your guesses checked, the game "
"will check that your solution _produces the same results_ as the "
"computer's, rather than that your solution is identical to the "
"computer's. So in the above example, you could put the fifth ball at "
"_any_ of the locations marked with an x, and you would still win. "
"\n"
"Black Box was contributed to this collection by James Harvey. "
"\n"
"\n#19.1 Black Box controls "
"\n"
"To fire a laser beam, left-click in a square around the edge of "
"the arena. The results will be displayed immediately. Clicking or "
"holding the left button on one of these squares will highlight the "
"current go (or a previous go) to confirm the exit point for that "
"laser, if applicable. "
"\n"
"To guess the location of a ball, left-click within the arena and a "
"black circle will appear marking the guess; click again to remove "
"the guessed ball. "
"\n"
"Locations in the arena may be locked against modification by right-\n"
"clicking; whole rows and columns may be similarly locked by right-\n"
"clicking in the laser square above/below that column, or to the "
"left/right of that row. "
"\n"
"The cursor keys may also be used to move around the grid. Pressing "
"the Enter key will fire a laser or add a new ball-location guess, "
"and pressing Space will lock a cell, row, or column. "
"\n"
"When an appropriate number of balls have been guessed, a button will "
"appear at the top-left corner of the grid; clicking that (with mouse "
"or cursor) will check your guesses. "
"\n"
"If you click the `check' button and your guesses are not correct, "
"the game will show you the minimum information necessary to "
"demonstrate this to you, so you can try again. If your ball "
"positions are not consistent with the beam paths you already know "
"about, one beam path will be circled to indicate that it proves you "
"wrong. If your positions match all the existing beam paths but are "
"still wrong, one new beam path will be revealed (written in red) "
"which is not consistent with your current guesses. "
"\n"
"If you decide to give up completely, you can select Solve to reveal "
"the actual ball positions. At this point, correctly-placed balls "
"will be displayed as filled black circles, incorrectly-placed balls "
"as filled black circles with red crosses, and missing balls as "
"filled red circles. In addition, a red circle marks any laser you "
"had already fired which is not consistent with your ball layout "
"(just as when you press the `check' button), and red text marks "
"any laser you _could_ have fired in order to distinguish your ball "
"layout from the correct one. "
"\n"
"(All the actions described in section 2.1 are also available.) "

"\n#19.2 Black Box parameters "
"\n"
"These parameters are available from the `Custom...' option on the "
"`Type' menu. "
"\n"
"_Width_, _Height_ "
"\n"
"Size of grid in squares. There are 2 x _Width_ x _Height_ lasers "
"per grid, two per row and two per column. "
"\n"
"_No. of balls_ "
"\n"
"Number of balls to place in the grid. This can be a single "
"number, or a range (separated with a hyphen, like `2-6'), "
"and determines the number of balls to place on the grid. "
"The `reveal' button is only enabled if you have guessed an "
"appropriate number of balls; a guess using a different number "
"to the original solution is still acceptable, if all the beam "
"inputs and outputs match. "
