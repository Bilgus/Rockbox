"#Chapter 14: Flip "
"\n"
"You have a grid of squares, some light and some dark. Your aim is to "
"light all the squares up at the same time. You can choose any square "
"and flip its state from light to dark or dark to light, but when you "
"do so, other squares around it change state as well. "
"\n"
"Each square contains a small diagram showing which other squares "
"change when you flip it. "
"\n"
"\n#14.1 Flip controls "
"\n"
"This game can be played with either the keyboard or the mouse. "
"\n"
"Left-click in a square to flip it and its associated squares, or use "
"the cursor keys to choose a square and the space bar or Enter key to "
"flip. "
"\n"
"If you use the `Solve' function on this game, it will mark some of "
"the squares in red. If you click once in every square with a red "
"mark, the game should be solved. (If you click in a square _without_ "
"a red mark, a red mark will appear in it to indicate that you will "
"need to reverse that operation to reach the solution.) "
"\n"
"(All the actions described in section 2.1 are also available.) "
"\n"
"\n#14.2 Flip parameters "
"\n"
"These parameters are available from the `Custom...' option on the "
"`Type' menu. "
"\n"
"_Width_, _Height_ "
"\n"
"Size of grid in squares. "
"\n"
"_Shape type_ "
"\n"
"This control determines the shape of the region which is flipped "
"by clicking in any given square. The default setting, `Crosses', "
"causes every square to flip itself and its four immediate "
"neighbours (or three or two if it's at an edge or corner). The "
"other setting, `Random', causes a random shape to be chosen for "
"every square, so the game is different every time. "
