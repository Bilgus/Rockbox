"\n"
"You have a grid of squares; each square (except the last one) "
"contains an arrow, and some squares also contain numbers. Your job "
"is to connect the squares to form a continuous list of numbers "
"starting at 1 and linked in the direction of the arrows - so the "
"arrow inside the square with the number 1 will point to the square "
"containing the number 2, which will point to the square containing "
"the number 3, etc. Each square can be any distance away from the "
"previous one, as long as it is somewhere in the direction of the "
"arrow. "
"\n"
"By convention the first and last numbers are shown; one or more "
"interim numbers may also appear at the beginning. "
"\n"
"Credit for this puzzle goes to Janko [17], who call it `Pfeilpfad' "
"(`arrow path'). "
"\n"
"Signpost was contributed to this collection by James Harvey. "

"\n#34.1 Signpost controls "
"\n"
"To play Signpost, you connect squares together by dragging from "
"one square to another, indicating that they are adjacent in the "
"sequence. Drag with the left button from a square to its successor, "
"or with the right button from a square to its predecessor. "
"\n"
"If you connect together two squares in this way and one of them has "
"a number in it, the appropriate number will appear in the other "
"square. If you connect two non-numbered squares, they will be "
"assigned temporary algebraic labels: on the first occasion, they "
"will be labelled `a' and `a+1', and then `b' and `b+1', and so on. "
"Connecting more squares on to the ends of such a chain will cause "
"them all to be labelled with the same letter. "
"\n"
"When you left-click or right-click in a square, the legal squares to "
"connect it to will be shown. "
"\n"
"The arrow in each square starts off black, and goes grey once you "
"connect the square to its successor. Also, each square which needs "
"a predecessor has a small dot in the bottom left corner, which "
"vanishes once you link a square to it. So your aim is always to "
"connect a square with a black arrow to a square with a dot. "
"\n"
"To remove any links for a particular square (both incoming and "
"outgoing), left-drag it off the grid. To remove a whole chain, "
"right-drag any square in the chain off the grid. "
"\n"
"You can also use the cursor keys to move around the grid squares "
"and lines. Pressing the return key when over a square starts a link "
"operation, and pressing the return key again over a square will "
"finish the link, if allowable. Pressing the space bar over a square "
"will show the other squares pointing to it, and allow you to form a "
"backward link, and pressing the space bar again cancels this. "
"\n"
"(All the actions described in section 2.1 are also available.) "

"\n#34.2 Signpost parameters "
"\n"
"These parameters are available from the `Custom...' option on the "
"`Type' menu. "
"\n"
"_Width_, _Height_ "
"\n"
"Size of grid in squares. "
"\n"
"_Force start/end to corners_ "
"\n"
"If true, the start and end squares are always placed in opposite "
"corners (the start at the top left, and the end at the bottom "
"right). If false the start and end squares are placed randomly "
"(although always both shown). "
