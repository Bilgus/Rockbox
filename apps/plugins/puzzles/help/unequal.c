"#Chapter 27: Unequal "
"\n"
"You have a square grid; each square may contain a digit from 1 to "
"the size of the grid, and some squares have clue signs between them. "
"Your aim is to fully populate the grid with numbers such that: "
"\n"
"- Each row contains only one occurrence of each digit "
"\n"
"- Each column contains only one occurrence of each digit "
"\n"
"- All the clue signs are satisfied. "
"\n"
"There are two modes for this game, `Unequal' and `Adjacent'. "
"\n"
"In `Unequal' mode, the clue signs are greater-than symbols "
"indicating one square's value is greater than its neighbour's. In "
"this mode not all clues may be visible, particularly at higher "
"difficulty levels. "
"\n"
"In `Adjacent' mode, the clue signs are bars indicating one square's "
"value is numerically adjacent (i.e. one higher or one lower) than "
"its neighbour. In this mode all clues are always visible: absence of "
"a bar thus means that a square's value is definitely not numerically "
"adjacent to that neighbour's. "
"\n"
"In `Trivial' difficulty level (available via the `Custom' game type "
"selector), there are no greater-than signs in `Unequal' mode; the "
"puzzle is to solve the Latin square only. "
"\n"
"At the time of writing, the `Unequal' mode of this puzzle is "
"appearing in the Guardian weekly under the name `Futoshiki'. "
"\n"
"Unequal was contributed to this collection by James Harvey. "
"\n"
"\n#27.1 Unequal controls "
"\n"
"Unequal shares much of its control system with Solo. "
"\n"
"To play Unequal, simply click the mouse in any empty square and then "
"type a digit or letter on the keyboard to fill that square. If you "
"make a mistake, click the mouse in the incorrect square and press "
"Space to clear it again (or use the Undo feature). "
"\n"
"If you _right_-click in a square and then type a number, that "
"number will be entered in the square as a `pencil mark'. You can "
"have pencil marks for multiple numbers in the same square. Squares "
"containing filled-in numbers cannot also contain pencil marks. "
"\n"
"The game pays no attention to pencil marks, so exactly what you "
"use them for is up to you: you can use them as reminders that a "
"particular square needs to be re-examined once you know more about "
"a particular number, or you can use them as lists of the possible "
"numbers in a given square, or anything else you feel like. "
"\n"
"To erase a single pencil mark, right-click in the square and type "
"the same number again. "
"\n"
"All pencil marks in a square are erased when you left-click and type "
"a number, or when you left-click and press space. Right-clicking and "
"pressing space will also erase pencil marks. "
"\n"
"As for Solo, the cursor keys can be used in conjunction with the "
"digit keys to set numbers or pencil marks. You can also use the `M' "
"key to auto-fill every numeric hint, ready for removal as required, "
"or the `H' key to do the same but also to remove all obvious hints. "
"\n"
"Alternatively, use the cursor keys to move the mark around the grid. "
"Pressing the return key toggles the mark (from a normal mark to a "
"pencil mark), and typing a number in is entered in the square in the "
"appropriate way; typing in a 0 or using the space bar will clear a "
"filled square. "
"\n"
"Left-clicking a clue will mark it as done (grey it out), or unmark "
"it if it is already marked. Holding Control or Shift and pressing "
"an arrow key likewise marks any clue adjacent to the cursor in the "
"given direction. "
"\n"
"(All the actions described in section 2.1 are also available.) "

"\n#27.2 Unequal parameters "
"\n"
"These parameters are available from the `Custom...' option on the "
"`Type' menu. "

"_Difficulty_ "
"\n"
"Controls the difficulty of the generated puzzle. At Trivial "
"level, there are no greater-than signs; the puzzle is to solve "
"the Latin square only. At Recursive level (only available via "
"the `Custom' game type selector) backtracking will be required, "
"but the solution should still be unique. The levels in between "
"require increasingly complex reasoning to avoid having to "
"backtrack. "
