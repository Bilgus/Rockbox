"\n"
"You are given a grid of squares, some of which contain diagonal "
"mirrors. Every square which is not a mirror must be filled with one "
"of three types of undead monster: a ghost, a vampire, or a zombie. "
"\n"
"Vampires can be seen directly, but are invisible when reflected in "
"mirrors. Ghosts are the opposite way round: they can be seen in "
"mirrors, but are invisible when looked at directly. Zombies are "
"visible by any means. "
"\n"
"You are also told the total number of each type of monster in the "
"grid. Also around the edge of the grid are written numbers, which "
"indicate how many monsters can be seen if you look into the grid "
"along a row or column starting from that position. (The diagonal "
"mirrors are reflective on both sides. If your reflected line of "
"sight crosses the same monster more than once, the number will count "
"it each time it is visible, not just once.) "
"\n"
"This puzzle type was invented by David Millar, under the name "
"`Haunted Mirror Maze'. See [20] for more details. "
"\n"
"Undead was contributed to this collection by Steffen Bauer. "

"\n#37.1 Undead controls "
"\n"
"Undead has a similar control system to Solo, Unequal and Keen. "
"\n"
"To play Undead, click the mouse in any empty square and then type "
"a letter on the keyboard indicating the type of monster: `G' for "
"a ghost, `V' for a vampire, or `Z' for a zombie. If you make a "
"mistake, click the mouse in the incorrect square and press Space to "
"clear it again (or use the Undo feature). "
"\n"
"If you _right_-click in a square and then type a letter, the "
"corresponding monster will be shown in reduced size in that square, "
"as a `pencil mark'. You can have pencil marks for multiple monsters "
"in the same square. A square containing a full-size monster cannot "
"also contain pencil marks. "
"\n"
"The game pays no attention to pencil marks, so exactly what you "
"use them for is up to you: you can use them as reminders that a "
"particular square needs to be re-examined once you know more about "
"a particular monster, or you can use them as lists of the possible "
"monster in a given square, or anything else you feel like. "
"\n"
"To erase a single pencil mark, right-click in the square and type "
"the same letter again. "
"\n"
"All pencil marks in a square are erased when you left-click and type "
"a monster letter, or when you left-click and press Space. Right-\n"
"clicking and pressing space will also erase pencil marks. "
"\n"
"As for Solo, the cursor keys can be used in conjunction with the "
"letter keys to place monsters or pencil marks. Use the cursor keys "
"to move a highlight around the grid, and type a monster letter to "
"enter it in the highlighted square. Pressing return toggles the "
"highlight into a mode in which you can enter or remove pencil marks. "
"\n"
"If you prefer plain letters of the alphabet to cute monster "
"pictures, you can press `A' to toggle between showing the monsters "
"as monsters or showing them as letters. "
"\n"
"Left-clicking a clue will mark it as done (grey it out), or unmark "
"it if it is already marked. "
"\n"
"(All the actions described in section 2.1 are also available.) "
