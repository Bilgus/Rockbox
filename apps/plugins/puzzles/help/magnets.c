"#Chapter 33: Magnets "
"\n"
"A rectangular grid has been filled with a mixture of magnets (that "
"is, dominoes with one positive end and one negative end) and blank "
"dominoes (that is, dominoes with two neutral poles). These dominoes "
"are initially only seen in silhouette. Around the grid are placed a "
"number of clues indicating the number of positive and negative poles "
"contained in certain columns and rows. "
"\n"
"Your aim is to correctly place the magnets and blank dominoes such "
"that all the clues are satisfied, with the additional constraint "
"that no two similar magnetic poles may be orthogonally adjacent "
"(since they repel). Neutral poles do not repel, and can be adjacent "
"to any other pole. "

"Credit for this puzzle goes to Janko [16]. "

"Magnets was contributed to this collection by James Harvey. "

"\n#33.1 Magnets controls "
"\n"
"Left-clicking on an empty square places a magnet at that position "
"with the positive pole on the square and the negative pole on the "
"other half of the magnet; left-clicking again reverses the polarity, "
"and a third click removes the magnet. "
"\n"
"Right-clicking on an empty square places a blank domino there. "
"Right-clicking again places two question marks on the domino, "
"signifying `this cannot be blank' (which can be useful to note "
"deductions while solving), and right-clicking again empties the "
"domino. "
"\n"
"Left-clicking a clue will mark it as done (grey it out), or unmark "
"it if it is already marked. "
"\n"
"You can also use the cursor keys to move a cursor around the grid. "
"Pressing the return key will lay a domino with a positive pole at "
"that position; pressing again reverses the polarity and then removes "
"the domino, as with left-clicking. Using the space bar allows "
"placement of blank dominoes and cannot-be-blank hints, as for right-\n"
"clicking. "

"\n#33.2 Magnets parameters "
"\n"
"These parameters are available from the `Custom...' option on the "
"`Type' menu. "
"\n"
"_Width_, _Height_ "
"\n"
"Size of grid in squares. There will be half _Width_ x _Height_ "
"dominoes in the grid: if this number is odd then one square will "
"be blank. "
"\n"
"(Grids with at least one odd dimension tend to be easier to "
"solve.) "
"\n"
"_Difficulty_ "
"\n"
"Controls the difficulty of the generated puzzle. At Tricky "
"level, you are required to make more deductions about empty "
"dominoes and row/column counts. "
"\n"
"_Strip clues_ "
"\n"
"If true, some of the clues around the grid are removed at "
"generation time, making the puzzle more difficult. "
