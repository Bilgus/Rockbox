"You have a grid of coloured squares, which you have to clear by "
"highlighting contiguous regions of more than one coloured square; "
"the larger the region you highlight, the more points you get (and "
"the faster you clear the arena). "
"\n"
"If you clear the grid you win. If you end up with nothing but single "
"squares (i.e., there are no more clickable regions left) you lose. "
"\n"
"Removing a region causes the rest of the grid to shuffle up: blocks "
"that are suspended will fall down (first), and then empty columns "
"are filled from the right. "
"\n"
"Same Game was contributed to this collection by James Harvey. "
"\n"
"\n#13.1 Same Game controls "
"\n"
"This game can be played with either the keyboard or the mouse. "
"\n"
"If you left-click an unselected region, it becomes selected "
"(possibly clearing the current selection). "
"\n"
"If you left-click the selected region, it will be removed (and the "
"rest of the grid shuffled immediately). "
"\n"
"If you right-click the selected region, it will be unselected. "
"\n"
"The cursor keys move a cursor around the grid. Pressing the Space or "
"Enter keys while the cursor is in an unselected region selects it; "
"pressing Space or Enter again removes it as above. "
"\n"
"(All the actions described in section 2.1 are also available.) "
"\n"
"\n#13.2 Same Game parameters "
"\n"
"These parameters are available from the `Custom...' option on the "
"`Type' menu. "
"\n"
"_Width_, _Height_ "
"\n"
"Size of grid in squares. "
"\n"
"_No. of colours_ "
"\n"
"Number of different colours used to fill the grid; the more "
"colours, the fewer large regions of colour and thus the more "
"difficult it is to successfully clear the grid. "
"\n"
"_Scoring system_ "
"\n"
"Controls the precise mechanism used for scoring. With the "
"default system, `(n-2)^2', only regions of three squares or more "
"will score any points at all. With the alternative `(n-1)^2' "
"system, regions of two squares score a point each, and larger "
"regions score relatively more points. "
"\n"
"_Ensure solubility_ "
"\n"
"If this option is ticked (the default state), generated grids "
"will be guaranteed to have at least one solution. "
"\n"
"If you turn it off, the game generator will not try to guarantee "
"soluble grids; it will, however, still ensure that there are at "
"least 2 squares of each colour on the grid at the start (since a "
"grid with exactly one square of a given colour is _definitely_ "
"insoluble). Grids generated with this option disabled may "
"contain more large areas of contiguous colour, leading to "
"opportunities for higher scores; they can also take less time to "
"generate. "
