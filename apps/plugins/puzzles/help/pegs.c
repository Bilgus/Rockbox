"#Chapter 16: Pegs "
"\n"
"A number of pegs are placed in holes on a board. You can remove a "
"peg by jumping an adjacent peg over it (horizontally or vertically) "
"to a vacant hole on the other side. Your aim is to remove all but "
"one of the pegs initially present. "
"\n"
"This game, best known as `Peg Solitaire', is possibly one of the "
"oldest puzzle games still commonly known. "
"\n"
"\n#16.1 Pegs controls "
"\n"
"To move a peg, drag it with the mouse from its current position to "
"its final position. If the final position is exactly two holes away "
"from the initial position, is currently unoccupied by a peg, and "
"there is a peg in the intervening square, the move will be permitted "
"and the intervening peg will be removed. "
"\n"
"Vacant spaces which you can move a peg into are marked with holes. A "
"space with no peg and no hole is not available for moving at all: it "
"is an obstacle which you must work around. "
"\n"
"You can also use the cursor keys to move a position indicator around "
"the board. Pressing the return key while over a peg, followed by a "
"cursor key, will jump the peg in that direction (if that is a legal "
"move). "
"\n"
"(All the actions described in section 2.1 are also available.) "
"\n"
"\n#16.2 Pegs parameters "
"\n"
"These parameters are available from the `Custom...' option on the "
"`Type' menu. "
"\n"
"_Width_, _Height_ "
"\n"
"Size of grid in holes. "
"\n"
"_Board type_ "
"\n"
"Controls whether you are given a board of a standard shape or "
"a randomly generated shape. The two standard shapes currently "
"supported are `Cross' and `Octagon' (also commonly known as the "
"English and European traditional board layouts respectively). "
"Selecting `Random' will give you a different board shape every "
"time (but always one that is known to have a solution). "
