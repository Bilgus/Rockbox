"#Chapter 3: Net "
"\n"
"(_Note:_ the Windows version of this game is called NETGAME.EXE to "
"avoid clashing with Windows's own NET.EXE.) "
"\n"
"I originally saw this in the form of a Flash game called "
"FreeNet [1], written by Pavils Jurjans; there are several other "
"implementations under the name NetWalk. The computer prepares a "
"network by connecting up the centres of squares in a grid, and then "
"shuffles the network by rotating every tile randomly. Your job is "
"to rotate it all back into place. The successful solution will be "
"an entirely connected network, with no closed loops. As a visual "
"aid, all tiles which are connected to the one in the middle are "
"highlighted. "
"\n"
"[1] http://www.jurjans.lv/stuff/net/FreeNet.htm "
"\n"
"\n#3.1 Net controls "
"\n"
"This game can be played with either the keyboard or the mouse. The "
"controls are: "
"\n"
"_Select tile_: mouse pointer, arrow keys "
"\n"
"_Rotate tile anticlockwise_: left mouse button, `A' key "
"\n"
"_Rotate tile clockwise_: right mouse button, `D' key "
"\n"
"_Rotate tile by 180 degrees_: `F' key "
"\n"
"_Lock (or unlock) tile_: middle mouse button, shift-click, `S' key "
"\n"
"You can lock a tile once you're sure of its orientation. You "
"can also unlock it again, but while it's locked you can't "
"accidentally turn it. "
"\n"
"The following controls are not necessary to complete the game, but "
"may be useful: "
"\n"
"_Shift grid_: Shift + arrow keys "
"\n"
"On grids that wrap, you can move the origin of the grid, so "
"that tiles that were on opposite sides of the grid can be seen "
"together. "
"\n"
"_Move centre_: Ctrl + arrow keys "
"\n"
"You can change which tile is used as the source of highlighting. "
"(It doesn't ultimately matter which tile this is, as every tile "
"will be connected to every other tile in a correct solution, "
"but it may be helpful in the intermediate stages of solving the "
"puzzle.) "
"\n"
"_Jumble tiles_: `J' key "
"\n"
"This key turns all tiles that are not locked to random "
"orientations. "
"\n"
"(All the actions described in section 2.1 are also available.) "
"\n"
"\n#3.2 Net parameters "
"\n"
"These parameters are available from the `Custom...' option on the "
"`Type' menu. "
"\n"
"_Width_, _Height_ "
"\n"
"Size of grid in tiles. "
"\n"
"_Walls wrap around_ "
"\n"
"If checked, flow can pass from the left edge to the right edge, "
"and from top to bottom, and vice versa. "
"\n"
"_Barrier probability_ "
"\n"
"A number between 0.0 and 1.0 controlling whether an immovable "
"barrier is placed between two tiles to prevent flow between "
"them (a higher number gives more barriers). Since barriers "
"are immovable, they act as constraints on the solution (i.e., "
"hints). "
"\n"
"The grid generation in Net has been carefully arranged so that "
"the barriers are independent of the rest of the grid. This "
"means that if you note down the random seed used to generate "
"the current puzzle (see section 2.2), change the _Barrier "
"probability_ parameter, and then re-enter the same random seed, "
"you should see exactly the same starting grid, with the only "
"change being the number of barriers. So if you're stuck on a "
"particular grid and need a hint, you could start up another "
"instance of Net, set up the same parameters but a higher barrier "
"probability, and enter the game seed from the original Net "
"window. "
"\n"
"_Ensure unique solution_ "
"\n"
"Normally, Net will make sure that the puzzles it presents have "
"only one solution. Puzzles with ambiguous sections can be more "
"difficult and more subtle, so if you like you can turn off this "
"feature and risk having ambiguous puzzles. (Also, finding _all_ "
"the possible solutions can be an additional challenge for an "
"advanced player.) "
"\n"
"#Chapter 4: Cube "
"\n"
"This is another one I originally saw as a web game. This one was a "
"Java game [2], by Paul Scott. You have a grid of 16 squares, six of "
"which are blue; on one square rests a cube. Your move is to use the "
"arrow keys to roll the cube through 90 degrees so that it moves to "
"an adjacent square. If you roll the cube on to a blue square, the "
"blue square is picked up on one face of the cube; if you roll a blue "
"face of the cube on to a non-blue square, the blueness is put down "
"again. (In general, whenever you roll the cube, the two faces that "
"come into contact swap colours.) Your job is to get all six blue "
"squares on to the six faces of the cube at the same time. Count your "
"moves and try to do it in as few as possible. "
"\n"
"Unlike the original Java game, my version has an additional feature: "
"once you've mastered the game with a cube rolling on a square grid, "
"you can change to a triangular grid and roll any of a tetrahedron, "
"an octahedron or an icosahedron. "
"\n"
"[2] http://www3.sympatico.ca/paulscott/cube/cube.htm "
"\n"
"\n#4.1 Cube controls "
"\n"
"This game can be played with either the keyboard or the mouse. "
"\n"
"Left-clicking anywhere on the window will move the cube (or other "
"solid) towards the mouse pointer. "
"\n"
"The arrow keys can also used to roll the cube on its square grid in "
"the four cardinal directions. On the triangular grids, the mapping "
"of arrow keys to directions is more approximate. Vertical movement "
"is disallowed where it doesn't make sense. The four keys surrounding "
"the arrow keys on the numeric keypad (`7', `9', `1', `3') can be "
"used for diagonal movement. "
"\n"
"(All the actions described in section 2.1 are also available.) "
"\n"
"\n#4.2 Cube parameters "
"\n"
"These parameters are available from the `Custom...' option on the "
"`Type' menu. "
"\n"
"_Type of solid_ "
"\n"
"Selects the solid to roll (and hence the shape of the grid): "
"tetrahedron, cube, octahedron, or icosahedron. "
"\n"
"_Width / top_, _Height / bottom_ "
"\n"
"On a square grid, horizontal and vertical dimensions. On a "
"triangular grid, the number of triangles on the top and bottom "
"rows respectively. "
"\n"
"#Chapter 5: Fifteen "
"\n"
"The old ones are the best: this is the good old `15-puzzle' with "
"sliding tiles. You have a 4x4 square grid; 15 squares contain "
"numbered tiles, and the sixteenth is empty. Your move is to choose a "
"tile next to the empty space, and slide it into the space. The aim "
"is to end up with the tiles in numerical order, with the space in "
"the bottom right (so that the top row reads 1,2,3,4 and the bottom "
"row reads 13,14,15,_space_). "
"\n"
"\n#5.1 Fifteen controls "
"\n"
"This game can be controlled with the mouse or the keyboard. "
"\n"
"A left-click with the mouse in the row or column containing the "
"empty space will move as many tiles as necessary to move the space "
"to the mouse pointer. "
"\n"
"The arrow keys will move a tile adjacent to the space in the "
"direction indicated (moving the space in the _opposite_ direction). "
"\n"
"Pressing `h' will make a suggested move. Pressing `h' enough times "
"will solve the game, but it may scramble your progress while doing "
"so. "
"\n"
"(All the actions described in section 2.1 are also available.) "
"\n"
"\n#5.2 Fifteen parameters "
"\n"
"The only options available from the `Custom...' option on the `Type' "
"menu are _Width_ and _Height_, which are self-explanatory. (Once "
"you've changed these, it's not a `15-puzzle' any more, of course!) "
"\n"
"#Chapter 6: Sixteen "
"\n"
"Another sliding tile puzzle, visually similar to Fifteen (see "
"chapter 5) but with a different type of move. This time, there is no "
"hole: all 16 squares on the grid contain numbered squares. Your move "
"is to shift an entire row left or right, or shift an entire column "
"up or down; every time you do that, the tile you shift off the grid "
"re-appears at the other end of the same row, in the space you just "
"vacated. To win, arrange the tiles into numerical order (1,2,3,4 on "
"the top row, 13,14,15,16 on the bottom). When you've done that, try "
"playing on different sizes of grid. "
"\n"
"I _might_ have invented this game myself, though only by accident "
"if so (and I'm sure other people have independently invented it). I "
"thought I was imitating a screensaver I'd seen, but I have a feeling "
"that the screensaver might actually have been a Fifteen-type puzzle "
"rather than this slightly different kind. So this might be the one "
"thing in my puzzle collection which represents creativity on my part "
"rather than just engineering. "
"\n"
"\n#6.1 Sixteen controls "
"\n"
"Left-clicking on an arrow will move the appropriate row or column in "
"the direction indicated. Right-clicking will move it in the opposite "
"direction. "
"\n"
"Alternatively, use the cursor keys to move the position indicator "
"around the edge of the grid, and use the return key to move the "
"row/column in the direction indicated. "
"\n"
"You can also move the tiles directly. Move the cursor onto a tile, "
"hold Control and press an arrow key to move the tile under the "
"cursor and move the cursor along with the tile. Or, hold Shift to "
"move only the tile. Pressing Enter simulates holding down Control "
"(press Enter again to release), while pressing Space simulates "
"holding down shift. "
"\n"
"(All the actions described in section 2.1 are also available.) "
"\n"
"\n#6.2 Sixteen parameters "
"\n"
"The parameters available from the `Custom...' option on the `Type' "
"menu are: "
"\n"
"- _Width_ and _Height_, which are self-explanatory. "
"\n"
"- You can ask for a limited shuffling operation to be performed on "
"the grid. By default, Sixteen will shuffle the grid in such a "
"way that any arrangement is about as probable as any other. You "
"can override this by requesting a precise number of shuffling "
"moves to be performed. Typically your aim is then to determine "
"the precise set of shuffling moves and invert them exactly, "
"so that you answer (say) a four-move shuffle with a four-move "
"solution. Note that the more moves you ask for, the more likely "
"it is that solutions shorter than the target length will turn "
"out to be possible. "
"\n"
"#Chapter 7: Twiddle "
"\n"
"Twiddle is a tile-rearrangement puzzle, visually similar to Sixteen "
"(see chapter 6): you are given a grid of square tiles, each "
"containing a number, and your aim is to arrange the numbers into "
"ascending order. "
"\n"
"In basic Twiddle, your move is to rotate a square group of four "
"tiles about their common centre. (Orientation is not significant "
"in the basic puzzle, although you can select it.) On more advanced "
"settings, you can rotate a larger square group of tiles. "
"\n"
"I first saw this type of puzzle in the GameCube game `Metroid "
"Prime 2'. In the Main Gyro Chamber in that game, there is a puzzle "
"you solve to unlock a door, which is a special case of Twiddle. I "
"developed this game as a generalisation of that puzzle. "
"\n"
"\n#7.1 Twiddle controls "
"\n"
"To play Twiddle, click the mouse in the centre of the square group "
"you wish to rotate. In the basic mode, you rotate a 2x2 square, "
"which means you have to click at a corner point where four tiles "
"meet. "
"\n"
"In more advanced modes you might be rotating 3x3 or even more at a "
"time; if the size of the square is odd then you simply click in the "
"centre tile of the square you want to rotate. "
"\n"
"Clicking with the left mouse button rotates the group anticlockwise. "
"Clicking with the right button rotates it clockwise. "
"\n"
"You can also move an outline square around the grid with the cursor "
"keys; the square is the size above (2x2 by default, or larger). "
"Pressing the return key or space bar will rotate the current square "
"anticlockwise or clockwise respectively. "
"\n"
"(All the actions described in section 2.1 are also available.) "
"\n"
"\n#7.2 Twiddle parameters "
"\n"
"Twiddle provides several configuration options via the `Custom' "
"option on the `Type' menu: "
"\n"
"- You can configure the width and height of the puzzle grid. "
"\n"
"- You can configure the size of square block that rotates at a "
"time. "
"\n"
"- You can ask for every square in the grid to be distinguishable "
"(the default), or you can ask for a simplified puzzle in which "
"there are groups of identical numbers. In the simplified puzzle "
"your aim is just to arrange all the 1s into the first row, all "
"the 2s into the second row, and so on. "
"\n"
"- You can configure whether the orientation of tiles matters. If "
"you ask for an orientable puzzle, each tile will have a triangle "
"drawn in it. All the triangles must be pointing upwards to "
"complete the puzzle. "
"\n"
"- You can ask for a limited shuffling operation to be performed "
"on the grid. By default, Twiddle will shuffle the grid so much "
"that any arrangement is about as probable as any other. You can "
"override this by requesting a precise number of shuffling moves "
"to be performed. Typically your aim is then to determine the "
"precise set of shuffling moves and invert them exactly, so that "
"you answer (say) a four-move shuffle with a four-move solution. "
"Note that the more moves you ask for, the more likely it is that "
"solutions shorter than the target length will turn out to be "
"possible. "
"\n"
"#Chapter 8: Rectangles "
"\n"
"You have a grid of squares, with numbers written in some (but "
"not all) of the squares. Your task is to subdivide the grid into "
"rectangles of various sizes, such that (a) every rectangle contains "
"exactly one numbered square, and (b) the area of each rectangle is "
"equal to the number written in its numbered square. "
"\n"
"Credit for this game goes to the Japanese puzzle magazine Nikoli [3] "
"; I've also seen a Palm implementation at Puzzle Palace [4]. Unlike "
"Puzzle Palace's implementation, my version automatically generates "
"random grids of any size you like. The quality of puzzle design is "
"therefore not quite as good as hand-crafted puzzles would be, but on "
"the plus side you get an inexhaustible supply of puzzles tailored to "
"your own specification. "

"\n"
"\n#8.1 Rectangles controls "
"\n"
"This game is played with the mouse or cursor keys. "
"\n"
"Left-click any edge to toggle it on or off, or left-click and "
"drag to draw an entire rectangle (or line) on the grid in one go "
"(removing any existing edges within that rectangle). Right-clicking "
"and dragging will allow you to erase the contents of a rectangle "
"without affecting its edges. "
"\n"
"Alternatively, use the cursor keys to move the position indicator "
"around the board. Pressing the return key then allows you to use the "
"cursor keys to drag a rectangle out from that position, and pressing "
"the return key again completes the rectangle. Using the space bar "
"instead of the return key allows you to erase the contents of a "
"rectangle without affecting its edges, as above. Pressing escape "
"cancels a drag. "
"\n"
"When a rectangle of the correct size is completed, it will be "
"shaded. "
"\n"
"(All the actions described in section 2.1 are also available.) "
"\n"
"\n#8.2 Rectangles parameters "
"\n"
"These parameters are available from the `Custom...' option on the "
"`Type' menu. "
"\n"
"_Width_, _Height_ "
"\n"
"Size of grid, in squares. "
"\n"
"_Expansion factor_ "
"\n"
"This is a mechanism for changing the type of grids generated by "
"the program. Some people prefer a grid containing a few large "
"rectangles to one containing many small ones. So you can ask "
"Rectangles to essentially generate a _smaller_ grid than the "
"size you specified, and then to expand it by adding rows and "
"columns. "
"\n"
"The default expansion factor of zero means that Rectangles will "
"simply generate a grid of the size you ask for, and do nothing "
"further. If you set an expansion factor of (say) 0.5, it means "
"that each dimension of the grid will be expanded to half again "
"as big after generation. In other words, the initial grid will "
"be 2/3 the size in each dimension, and will be expanded to its "
"full size without adding any more rectangles. "
"\n"
"Setting an expansion factor of around 0.5 tends to make the "
"game more difficult, and also (in my experience) rewards a "
"less deductive and more intuitive playing style. If you set it "
"_too_ high, though, the game simply cannot generate more than a "
"few rectangles to cover the entire grid, and the game becomes "
"trivial. "
"\n"
"_Ensure unique solution_ "
"\n"
"Normally, Rectangles will make sure that the puzzles it presents "
"have only one solution. Puzzles with ambiguous sections can be "
"more difficult and more subtle, so if you like you can turn off "
"this feature and risk having ambiguous puzzles. Also, finding "
"_all_ the possible solutions can be an additional challenge for "
"an advanced player. Turning off this option can also speed up "
"puzzle generation. "
"\n"
"#Chapter 9: Netslide "
"\n"
"This game combines the grid generation of Net (see chapter 3) with "
"the movement of Sixteen (see chapter 6): you have a Net grid, but "
"instead of rotating tiles back into place you have to slide them "
"into place by moving a whole row at a time. "
"\n"
"As in Sixteen, control is with the mouse or cursor keys. See section "
"6.1. "
"\n"
"The available game parameters have similar meanings to those in Net "
"(see section 3.2) and Sixteen (see section 6.2). "
"\n"
"Netslide was contributed to this collection by Richard Boulton. "
"\n"
"#Chapter 10: Pattern "
"\n"
"You have a grid of squares, which must all be filled in either black "
"or white. Beside each row of the grid are listed the lengths of the "
"runs of black squares on that row; above each column are listed the "
"lengths of the runs of black squares in that column. Your aim is to "
"fill in the entire grid black or white. "
"\n"
"I first saw this puzzle form around 1995, under the name "
"`nonograms'. I've seen it in various places since then, under "
"different names. "
"\n"
"Normally, puzzles of this type turn out to be a meaningful picture "
"of something once you've solved them. However, since this version "
"generates the puzzles automatically, they will just look like random "
"groupings of squares. (One user has suggested that this is actually "
"a _good_ thing, since it prevents you from guessing the colour of "
"squares based on the picture, and forces you to use logic instead.) "
"The advantage, though, is that you never run out of them. "
"\n"
"\n#10.1 Pattern controls "
"\n"
"This game is played with the mouse. "
"\n"
"Left-click in a square to colour it black. Right-click to colour it "
"white. If you make a mistake, you can middle-click, or hold down "
"Shift while clicking with any button, to colour the square in the "
"default grey (meaning `undecided') again. "
"\n"
"You can click and drag with the left or right mouse button to colour "
"a vertical or horizontal line of squares black or white at a time "
"(respectively). If you click and drag with the middle button, or "
"with Shift held down, you can colour a whole rectangle of squares "
"grey. "
"\n"
"You can also move around the grid with the cursor keys. Pressing the "
"return key will cycle the current cell through empty, then black, "
"then white, then empty, and the space bar does the same cycle in "
"reverse. "
"\n"
"Moving the cursor while holding Control will colour the moved-over "
"squares black. Holding Shift will colour the moved-over squares "
"white, and holding both will colour them grey. "
"\n"
"(All the actions described in section 2.1 are also available.) "
"\n"
"\n#10.2 Pattern parameters "
"\n"
"The only options available from the `Custom...' option on the `Type' "
"menu are _Width_ and _Height_, which are self-explanatory. "
"\n"
"#Chapter 11: Solo "
"\n"
"You have a square grid, which is divided into as many equally sized "
"sub-blocks as the grid has rows. Each square must be filled in with "
"a digit from 1 to the size of the grid, in such a way that "
"\n"
"- every row contains only one occurrence of each digit "
"\n"
"- every column contains only one occurrence of each digit "
"\n"
"- every block contains only one occurrence of each digit. "
"\n"
"- (optionally, by default off) each of the square's two main "
"diagonals contains only one occurrence of each digit. "
"\n"
"You are given some of the numbers as clues; your aim is to place the "
"rest of the numbers correctly. "
"\n"
"Under the default settings, the sub-blocks are square or "
"rectangular. The default puzzle size is 3x3 (a 9x9 actual grid, "
"divided into nine 3x3 blocks). You can also select sizes with "
"rectangular blocks instead of square ones, such as 2x3 (a 6x6 grid "
"divided into six 3x2 blocks). Alternatively, you can select `jigsaw' "
"mode, in which the sub-blocks are arbitrary shapes which differ "
"between individual puzzles. "
"\n"
"Another available mode is `killer'. In this mode, clues are not "
"given in the form of filled-in squares; instead, the grid is divided "
"into `cages' by coloured lines, and for each cage the game tells "
"you what the sum of all the digits in that cage should be. Also, "
"no digit may appear more than once within a cage, even if the cage "
"crosses the boundaries of existing regions. "
"\n"
"If you select a puzzle size which requires more than 9 digits, the "
"additional digits will be letters of the alphabet. For example, if "
"you select 3x4 then the digits which go in your grid will be 1 to 9, "
"plus `a', `b' and `c'. This cannot be selected for killer puzzles. "
"\n"
"I first saw this puzzle in Nikoli [5], although it's also been "
"popularised by various newspapers under the name `Sudoku' or `Su "
"Doku'. Howard Garns is considered the inventor of the modern form of "
"the puzzle, and it was first published in _Dell Pencil Puzzles and "
"Word Games_. A more elaborate treatment of the history of the puzzle "
"can be found on Wikipedia [6]. "

"\n"
"\n#11.1 Solo controls "
"\n"
"To play Solo, simply click the mouse in any empty square and then "
"type a digit or letter on the keyboard to fill that square. If you "
"make a mistake, click the mouse in the incorrect square and press "
"Space to clear it again (or use the Undo feature). "
"\n"
"If you _right_-click in a square and then type a number, that "
"number will be entered in the square as a `pencil mark'. You can "
"have pencil marks for multiple numbers in the same square. Squares "
"containing filled-in numbers cannot also contain pencil marks. "
"\n"
"The game pays no attention to pencil marks, so exactly what you "
"use them for is up to you: you can use them as reminders that a "
"particular square needs to be re-examined once you know more about "
"a particular number, or you can use them as lists of the possible "
"numbers in a given square, or anything else you feel like. "
"\n"
"To erase a single pencil mark, right-click in the square and type "
"the same number again. "
"\n"
"All pencil marks in a square are erased when you left-click and type "
"a number, or when you left-click and press space. Right-clicking and "
"pressing space will also erase pencil marks. "
"\n"
"Alternatively, use the cursor keys to move the mark around the grid. "
"Pressing the return key toggles the mark (from a normal mark to a "
"pencil mark), and typing a number in is entered in the square in the "
"appropriate way; typing in a 0 or using the space bar will clear a "
"filled square. "
"\n"
"(All the actions described in section 2.1 are also available.) "
"\n"
"\n#11.2 Solo parameters "
"\n"
"Solo allows you to configure two separate dimensions of the puzzle "
"grid on the `Type' menu: the number of columns, and the number of "
"rows, into which the main grid is divided. (The size of a block is "
"the inverse of this: for example, if you select 2 columns and 3 "
"rows, each actual block will have 3 columns and 2 rows.) "
"\n"
"If you tick the `X' checkbox, Solo will apply the optional extra "
"constraint that the two main diagonals of the grid also contain "
"one of every digit. (This is sometimes known as `Sudoku-X' in "
"newspapers.) In this mode, the squares on the two main diagonals "
"will be shaded slightly so that you know it's enabled. "
"\n"
"If you tick the `Jigsaw' checkbox, Solo will generate randomly "
"shaped sub-blocks. In this mode, the actual grid size will be taken "
"to be the product of the numbers entered in the `Columns' and `Rows' "
"boxes. There is no reason why you have to enter a number greater "
"than 1 in both boxes; Jigsaw mode has no constraint on the grid "
"size, and it can even be a prime number if you feel like it. "
"\n"
"If you tick the `Killer' checkbox, Solo will generate a set of "
"of cages, which are randomly shaped and drawn in an outline of a "
"different colour. Each of these regions contains a smaller clue "
"which shows the digit sum of all the squares in this region. "
"\n"
"You can also configure the type of symmetry shown in the generated "
"puzzles. More symmetry makes the puzzles look prettier but may also "
"make them easier, since the symmetry constraints can force more "
"clues than necessary to be present. Completely asymmetric puzzles "
"have the freedom to contain as few clues as possible. "
"\n"
"Finally, you can configure the difficulty of the generated puzzles. "
"Difficulty levels are judged by the complexity of the techniques "
"of deduction required to solve the puzzle: each level requires a "
"mode of reasoning which was not necessary in the previous one. In "
"particular, on difficulty levels `Trivial' and `Basic' there will be "
"a square you can fill in with a single number at all times, whereas "
"at `Intermediate' level and beyond you will have to make partial "
"deductions about the _set_ of squares a number could be in (or the "
"set of numbers that could be in a square). At `Unreasonable' level, "
"even this is not enough, and you will eventually have to make a "
"guess, and then backtrack if it turns out to be wrong. "
"\n"
"Generating difficult puzzles is itself difficult: if you select one "
"of the higher difficulty levels, Solo may have to make many attempts "
"at generating a puzzle before it finds one hard enough for you. Be "
"prepared to wait, especially if you have also configured a large "
"puzzle size. "

"#Chapter 12: Mines "
"\n"
"You have a grid of covered squares, some of which contain mines, but "
"you don't know which. Your job is to uncover every square which does "
"_not_ contain a mine. If you uncover a square containing a mine, you "
"lose. If you uncover a square which does not contain a mine, you "
"are told how many mines are contained within the eight surrounding "
"squares. "
"\n"
"This game needs no introduction; popularised by Windows, it is "
"perhaps the single best known desktop puzzle game in existence. "
"\n"
"This version of it has an unusual property. By default, it will "
"generate its mine positions in such a way as to ensure that you "
"never need to _guess_ where a mine is: you will always be able "
"to deduce it somehow. So you will never, as can happen in other "
"versions, get to the last four squares and discover that there are "
"two mines left but you have no way of knowing for sure where they "
"are. "
"\n"
"\n#12.1 Mines controls "
"\n"
"This game is played with the mouse. "
"\n"
"If you left-click in a covered square, it will be uncovered. "
"\n"
"If you right-click in a covered square, it will place a flag which "
"indicates that the square is believed to be a mine. Left-clicking in "
"a marked square will not uncover it, for safety. You can right-click "
"again to remove a mark placed in error. "
"\n"
"If you left-click in an _uncovered_ square, it will `clear around' "
"the square. This means: if the square has exactly as many flags "
"surrounding it as it should have mines, then all the covered squares "
"next to it which are _not_ flagged will be uncovered. So once you "
"think you know the location of all the mines around a square, you "
"can use this function as a shortcut to avoid having to click on each "
"of the remaining squares one by one. "
"\n"
"If you uncover a square which has _no_ mines in the surrounding "
"eight squares, then it is obviously safe to uncover those squares in "
"turn, and so on if any of them also has no surrounding mines. This "
"will be done for you automatically; so sometimes when you uncover a "
"square, a whole new area will open up to be explored. "
"\n"
"You can also use the cursor keys to move around the minefield. "
"Pressing the return key in a covered square uncovers it, and in "
"an uncovered square will clear around it (so it acts as the left "
"button), pressing the space bar in a covered square will place a "
"flag (similarly, it acts as the right button). "
"\n"
"All the actions described in section 2.1 are also available. "
"\n"
"Even Undo is available, although you might consider it cheating to "
"use it. If you step on a mine, the program will only reveal the mine "
"in question (unlike most other implementations, which reveal all of "
"them). You can then Undo your fatal move and continue playing if you "
"like. The program will track the number of times you died (and Undo "
"will not reduce that counter), so when you get to the end of the "
"game you know whether or not you did it without making any errors. "
"\n"
"(If you really want to know the full layout of the grid, which other "
"implementations will show you after you die, you can always use the "
"Solve menu option.) "
"\n"
"\n#12.2 Mines parameters "
"\n"
"The options available from the `Custom...' option on the `Type' menu "
"are: "
"\n"
"_Width_, _Height_ "
"\n"
"Size of grid in squares. "
"\n"
"_Mines_ "
"\n"
"Number of mines in the grid. You can enter this as an absolute "
"mine count, or alternatively you can put a % sign on the end "
"in which case the game will arrange for that proportion of the "
"squares in the grid to be mines. "
"\n"
"Beware of setting the mine count too high. At very high "
"densities, the program may spend forever searching for a "
"solvable grid. "
"\n"
"_Ensure solubility_ "
"\n"
"When this option is enabled (as it is by default), Mines will "
"ensure that the entire grid can be fully deduced starting "
"from the initial open space. If you prefer the riskier grids "
"generated by other implementations, you can switch off this "
"option. "
"\n"
"#Chapter 13: Same Game "
"\n"
"You have a grid of coloured squares, which you have to clear by "
"highlighting contiguous regions of more than one coloured square; "
"the larger the region you highlight, the more points you get (and "
"the faster you clear the arena). "
"\n"
"If you clear the grid you win. If you end up with nothing but single "
"squares (i.e., there are no more clickable regions left) you lose. "
"\n"
"Removing a region causes the rest of the grid to shuffle up: blocks "
"that are suspended will fall down (first), and then empty columns "
"are filled from the right. "
"\n"
"Same Game was contributed to this collection by James Harvey. "
"\n"
"\n#13.1 Same Game controls "
"\n"
"This game can be played with either the keyboard or the mouse. "
"\n"
"If you left-click an unselected region, it becomes selected "
"(possibly clearing the current selection). "
"\n"
"If you left-click the selected region, it will be removed (and the "
"rest of the grid shuffled immediately). "
"\n"
"If you right-click the selected region, it will be unselected. "
"\n"
"The cursor keys move a cursor around the grid. Pressing the Space or "
"Enter keys while the cursor is in an unselected region selects it; "
"pressing Space or Enter again removes it as above. "
"\n"
"(All the actions described in section 2.1 are also available.) "
"\n"
"\n#13.2 Same Game parameters "
"\n"
"These parameters are available from the `Custom...' option on the "
"`Type' menu. "
"\n"
"_Width_, _Height_ "
"\n"
"Size of grid in squares. "
"\n"
"_No. of colours_ "
"\n"
"Number of different colours used to fill the grid; the more "
"colours, the fewer large regions of colour and thus the more "
"difficult it is to successfully clear the grid. "
"\n"
"_Scoring system_ "
"\n"
"Controls the precise mechanism used for scoring. With the "
"default system, `(n-2)^2', only regions of three squares or more "
"will score any points at all. With the alternative `(n-1)^2' "
"system, regions of two squares score a point each, and larger "
"regions score relatively more points. "
"\n"
"_Ensure solubility_ "
"\n"
"If this option is ticked (the default state), generated grids "
"will be guaranteed to have at least one solution. "
"\n"
"If you turn it off, the game generator will not try to guarantee "
"soluble grids; it will, however, still ensure that there are at "
"least 2 squares of each colour on the grid at the start (since a "
"grid with exactly one square of a given colour is _definitely_ "
"insoluble). Grids generated with this option disabled may "
"contain more large areas of contiguous colour, leading to "
"opportunities for higher scores; they can also take less time to "
"generate. "
"\n"
"#Chapter 14: Flip "
"\n"
"You have a grid of squares, some light and some dark. Your aim is to "
"light all the squares up at the same time. You can choose any square "
"and flip its state from light to dark or dark to light, but when you "
"do so, other squares around it change state as well. "
"\n"
"Each square contains a small diagram showing which other squares "
"change when you flip it. "
"\n"
"\n#14.1 Flip controls "
"\n"
"This game can be played with either the keyboard or the mouse. "
"\n"
"Left-click in a square to flip it and its associated squares, or use "
"the cursor keys to choose a square and the space bar or Enter key to "
"flip. "
"\n"
"If you use the `Solve' function on this game, it will mark some of "
"the squares in red. If you click once in every square with a red "
"mark, the game should be solved. (If you click in a square _without_ "
"a red mark, a red mark will appear in it to indicate that you will "
"need to reverse that operation to reach the solution.) "
"\n"
"(All the actions described in section 2.1 are also available.) "
"\n"
"\n#14.2 Flip parameters "
"\n"
"These parameters are available from the `Custom...' option on the "
"`Type' menu. "
"\n"
"_Width_, _Height_ "
"\n"
"Size of grid in squares. "
"\n"
"_Shape type_ "
"\n"
"This control determines the shape of the region which is flipped "
"by clicking in any given square. The default setting, `Crosses', "
"causes every square to flip itself and its four immediate "
"neighbours (or three or two if it's at an edge or corner). The "
"other setting, `Random', causes a random shape to be chosen for "
"every square, so the game is different every time. "
"\n"
"#Chapter 15: Guess "
"\n"
"You have a set of coloured pegs, and have to reproduce a "
"predetermined sequence of them (chosen by the computer) within a "
"certain number of guesses. "
"\n"
"Each guess gets marked with the number of correctly-coloured pegs "
"in the correct places (in black), and also the number of correctly-\n"
"coloured pegs in the wrong places (in white). "
"\n"
"This game is also known (and marketed, by Hasbro, mainly) as a board "
"game `Mastermind', with 6 colours, 4 pegs per row, and 10 guesses. "
"However, this version allows custom settings of number of colours "
"(up to 10), number of pegs per row, and number of guesses. "
"\n"
"Guess was contributed to this collection by James Harvey. "
"\n"
"\n#15.1 Guess controls "
"\n"
"This game can be played with either the keyboard or the mouse. "
"\n"
"With the mouse, drag a coloured peg from the tray on the left-hand "
"side to its required position in the current guess; pegs may also "
"be dragged from current and past guesses to copy them elsewhere. To "
"remove a peg, drag it off its current position to somewhere invalid. "
"\n"
"Right-clicking in the current guess adds a `hold' marker; pegs that "
"have hold markers will be automatically added to the next guess "
"after marking. "
"\n"
"Alternatively, with the keyboard, the up and down cursor keys can "
"be used to select a peg colour, the left and right keys to select a "
"peg position, and the space bar or Enter key to place a peg of the "
"selected colour in the chosen position. `D' or Backspace removes a "
"peg, and Space adds a hold marker. "
"\n"
"Pressing `h' or `?' will fill the current guess with a suggested "
"guess. Using this is not recommended for 10 or more pegs as it is "
"slow. "
"\n"
"When the guess is complete, the smaller feedback pegs will be "
"highlighted; clicking on these (or moving the peg cursor to them "
"with the arrow keys and pressing the space bar or Enter key) will "
"mark the current guess, copy any held pegs to the next guess, and "
"move the `current guess' marker. "
"\n"
"If you correctly position all the pegs the solution will be "
"displayed below; if you run out of guesses (or select `Solve...') "
"the solution will also be revealed. "
"\n"
"(All the actions described in section 2.1 are also available.) "
"\n"
"\n#15.2 Guess parameters "
"\n"
"These parameters are available from the `Custom...' option on the "
"`Type' menu. The default game matches the parameters for the board "
"game `Mastermind'. "
"\n"
"_Colours_ "
"\n"
"Number of colours the solution is chosen from; from 2 to 10 "
"(more is harder). "
"\n"
"_Pegs per guess_ "
"\n"
"Number of pegs per guess (more is harder). "
"\n"
"_Guesses_ "
"\n"
"Number of guesses you have to find the solution in (fewer is "
"harder). "
"\n"
"_Allow blanks_ "
"\n"
"Allows blank pegs to be given as part of a guess (makes it "
"easier, because you know that those will never be counted as "
"part of the solution). This is turned off by default. "
"\n"
"Note that this doesn't allow blank pegs in the solution; if you "
"really wanted that, use one extra colour. "
"\n"
"_Allow duplicates_ "
"\n"
"Allows the solution (and the guesses) to contain colours more "
"than once; this increases the search space (making things "
"harder), and is turned on by default. "
"\n"
"#Chapter 16: Pegs "
"\n"
"A number of pegs are placed in holes on a board. You can remove a "
"peg by jumping an adjacent peg over it (horizontally or vertically) "
"to a vacant hole on the other side. Your aim is to remove all but "
"one of the pegs initially present. "
"\n"
"This game, best known as `Peg Solitaire', is possibly one of the "
"oldest puzzle games still commonly known. "
"\n"
"\n#16.1 Pegs controls "
"\n"
"To move a peg, drag it with the mouse from its current position to "
"its final position. If the final position is exactly two holes away "
"from the initial position, is currently unoccupied by a peg, and "
"there is a peg in the intervening square, the move will be permitted "
"and the intervening peg will be removed. "
"\n"
"Vacant spaces which you can move a peg into are marked with holes. A "
"space with no peg and no hole is not available for moving at all: it "
"is an obstacle which you must work around. "
"\n"
"You can also use the cursor keys to move a position indicator around "
"the board. Pressing the return key while over a peg, followed by a "
"cursor key, will jump the peg in that direction (if that is a legal "
"move). "
"\n"
"(All the actions described in section 2.1 are also available.) "
"\n"
"\n#16.2 Pegs parameters "
"\n"
"These parameters are available from the `Custom...' option on the "
"`Type' menu. "
"\n"
"_Width_, _Height_ "
"\n"
"Size of grid in holes. "
"\n"
"_Board type_ "
"\n"
"Controls whether you are given a board of a standard shape or "
"a randomly generated shape. The two standard shapes currently "
"supported are `Cross' and `Octagon' (also commonly known as the "
"English and European traditional board layouts respectively). "
"Selecting `Random' will give you a different board shape every "
"time (but always one that is known to have a solution). "
"\n"
"#Chapter 17: Dominosa "
"\n"
"A normal set of dominoes - that is, one instance of every "
"(unordered) pair of numbers from 0 to 6 - has been arranged "
"irregularly into a rectangle; then the number in each square has "
"been written down and the dominoes themselves removed. Your task is "
"to reconstruct the pattern by arranging the set of dominoes to match "
"the provided array of numbers. "
"\n"
"This puzzle is widely credited to O. S. Adler, and takes part of its "
"name from those initials. "
"\n"
"\n#17.1 Dominosa controls "
"\n"
"Left-clicking between any two adjacent numbers places a domino "
"covering them, or removes one if it is already present. Trying to "
"place a domino which overlaps existing dominoes will remove the ones "
"it overlaps. "
"\n"
"Right-clicking between two adjacent numbers draws a line between "
"them, which you can use to remind yourself that you know those two "
"numbers are _not_ covered by a single domino. Right-clicking again "
"removes the line. "
"\n"
"You can also use the cursor keys to move a cursor around the grid. "
"When the cursor is half way between two adjacent numbers, pressing "
"the return key will place a domino covering those numbers, or "
"pressing the space bar will lay a line between the two squares. "
"Repeating either action removes the domino or line. "
"\n"
"Pressing a number key will highlight all occurrences of that number. "
"Pressing that number again will clear the highlighting. Up to two "
"different numbers can be highlighted at any given time. "
"\n"
"(All the actions described in section 2.1 are also available.) "
"\n"
"\n#17.2 Dominosa parameters "
"\n"
"These parameters are available from the `Custom...' option on the "
"`Type' menu. "
"\n"
"_Maximum number on dominoes_ "
"\n"
"Controls the size of the puzzle, by controlling the size of the "
"set of dominoes used to make it. Dominoes with numbers going "
"up to N will give rise to an (N+2) x (N+1) rectangle; so, in "
"particular, the default value of 6 gives an 8x7 grid. "
"\n"
"_Ensure unique solution_ "
"\n"
"Normally, Dominosa will make sure that the puzzles it presents "
"have only one solution. Puzzles with ambiguous sections can be "
"more difficult and sometimes more subtle, so if you like you "
"can turn off this feature. Also, finding _all_ the possible "
"solutions can be an additional challenge for an advanced player. "
"Turning off this option can also speed up puzzle generation. "
"\n"
"#Chapter 18: Untangle "

"#Chapter 19: Black Box "
"\n"
"A number of balls are hidden in a rectangular arena. You have to "
"deduce the positions of the balls by firing lasers positioned at the "
"edges of the arena and observing how their beams are deflected. "
"\n"
"Beams will travel straight from their origin until they hit the "
"opposite side of the arena (at which point they emerge), unless "
"affected by balls in one of the following ways: "
"\n"
"- A beam that hits a ball head-on is absorbed and will never re-\n"
"emerge. This includes beams that meet a ball on the first rank "
"of the arena. "
"\n"
"- A beam with a ball in its front-left square and no ball ahead of "
"it gets deflected 90 degrees to the right. "
"\n"
"- A beam with a ball in its front-right square and no ball ahead "
"of it gets similarly deflected to the left. "
"\n"
"- A beam that would re-emerge from its entry location is "
"considered to be `reflected'. "
"\n"
"- A beam which would get deflected before entering the arena by a "
"ball to the front-left or front-right of its entry point is also "
"considered to be `reflected'. "
"\n"
"Beams that are reflected appear as a `R'; beams that hit balls head-\n"
"on appear as `H'. Otherwise, a number appears at the firing point "
"and the location where the beam emerges (this number is unique to "
"that shot). "
"\n"
"You can place guesses as to the location of the balls, based on the "
"entry and exit patterns of the beams; once you have placed enough "
"balls a button appears enabling you to have your guesses checked. "
"\n"
"Here is a diagram showing how the positions of balls can create each "
"of the beam behaviours shown above: "
"\n"
"1RHR----\n"
"|..O.O...|\n"
"2........3\n"
"|........|\n"
"|........|\n"
"3........|\n"
"|......O.|\n"
"H........|\n"
"|.....O..|\n"
"12-RR---\n"
"\n"
"As shown, it is possible for a beam to receive multiple reflections "
"before re-emerging (see turn 3). Similarly, a beam may be reflected "
"(possibly more than once) before receiving a hit (the `H' on the "
"left side of the example). "
"\n"
"Note that any layout with more than 4 balls may have a non-unique "
"solution. The following diagram illustrates this; if you know the "
"board contains 5 balls, it is impossible to determine where the "
"fifth ball is (possible positions marked with an x): "
"\n"
"--------\n"
"|........|\n"
"|........|\n"
"|..O..O..|\n"
"|...xx...|\n"
"|...xx...|\n"
"|..O..O..|\n"
"|........|\n"
"|........|\n"
"--------\n"
"\n"
"For this reason, when you have your guesses checked, the game "
"will check that your solution _produces the same results_ as the "
"computer's, rather than that your solution is identical to the "
"computer's. So in the above example, you could put the fifth ball at "
"_any_ of the locations marked with an x, and you would still win. "
"\n"
"Black Box was contributed to this collection by James Harvey. "
"\n"
"\n#19.1 Black Box controls "
"\n"
"To fire a laser beam, left-click in a square around the edge of "
"the arena. The results will be displayed immediately. Clicking or "
"holding the left button on one of these squares will highlight the "
"current go (or a previous go) to confirm the exit point for that "
"laser, if applicable. "
"\n"
"To guess the location of a ball, left-click within the arena and a "
"black circle will appear marking the guess; click again to remove "
"the guessed ball. "
"\n"
"Locations in the arena may be locked against modification by right-\n"
"clicking; whole rows and columns may be similarly locked by right-\n"
"clicking in the laser square above/below that column, or to the "
"left/right of that row. "
"\n"
"The cursor keys may also be used to move around the grid. Pressing "
"the Enter key will fire a laser or add a new ball-location guess, "
"and pressing Space will lock a cell, row, or column. "
"\n"
"When an appropriate number of balls have been guessed, a button will "
"appear at the top-left corner of the grid; clicking that (with mouse "
"or cursor) will check your guesses. "
"\n"
"If you click the `check' button and your guesses are not correct, "
"the game will show you the minimum information necessary to "
"demonstrate this to you, so you can try again. If your ball "
"positions are not consistent with the beam paths you already know "
"about, one beam path will be circled to indicate that it proves you "
"wrong. If your positions match all the existing beam paths but are "
"still wrong, one new beam path will be revealed (written in red) "
"which is not consistent with your current guesses. "
"\n"
"If you decide to give up completely, you can select Solve to reveal "
"the actual ball positions. At this point, correctly-placed balls "
"will be displayed as filled black circles, incorrectly-placed balls "
"as filled black circles with red crosses, and missing balls as "
"filled red circles. In addition, a red circle marks any laser you "
"had already fired which is not consistent with your ball layout "
"(just as when you press the `check' button), and red text marks "
"any laser you _could_ have fired in order to distinguish your ball "
"layout from the correct one. "

"#Chapter 20: Slant "
"\n"
"You have a grid of squares. Your aim is to draw a diagonal line "
"through each square, and choose which way each line slants so that "
"the following conditions are met: "
"\n"
"- The diagonal lines never form a loop. "
"\n"
"- Any point with a circled number has precisely that many lines "
"meeting at it. (Thus, a 4 is the centre of a cross shape, "
"whereas a zero is the centre of a diamond shape - or rather, a "
"partial diamond shape, because a zero can never appear in the "
"middle of the grid because that would immediately cause a loop.) "
"\n"
"Credit for this puzzle goes to Nikoli [8]. "

"\n"
"\n#20.1 Slant controls "
"\n"
"Left-clicking in a blank square will place a \\ in it (a line leaning "
"to the left, i.e. running from the top left of the square to the "
"bottom right). Right-clicking in a blank square will place a / in it "
"(leaning to the right, running from top right to bottom left). "
"\n"
"Continuing to click either button will cycle between the three "
"possible square contents. Thus, if you left-click repeatedly in a "
"blank square it will change from blank to \\ to / back to blank, and "
"if you right-click repeatedly the square will change from blank to / "
"to \\ back to blank. (Therefore, you can play the game entirely with "
"one button if you need to.) "
"\n"
"You can also use the cursor keys to move around the grid. Pressing "
"the return or space keys will place a \\ or a /, respectively, and "
"will then cycle them as above. You can also press / or \\ to place a "

"you might know that two squares slant in the same direction, "

"#Chapter 22: Map "
"\n"
"You are given a map consisting of a number of regions. Your task is "
"to colour each region with one of four colours, in such a way that "
"no two regions sharing a boundary have the same colour. You are "
"provided with some regions already coloured, sufficient to make the "
"remainder of the solution unique. "
"\n"
"Only regions which share a length of border are required to be "
"different colours. Two regions which meet at only one _point_ (i.e. "
"are diagonally separated) may be the same colour. "
"\n"
"I believe this puzzle is original; I've never seen an implementation "
"of it anywhere else. The concept of a four-colouring puzzle was "
"suggested by Owen Dunn; credit must also go to Nikoli and to Verity "
"Allan for inspiring the train of thought that led to me realising "
"Owen's suggestion was a viable puzzle. Thanks also to Gareth Taylor "
"for many detailed suggestions. "
"\n"
"\n#22.1 Map controls "
"\n"
"To colour a region, click the left mouse button on an existing "
"region of the desired colour and drag that colour into the new "
"region. "
"\n"
"(The program will always ensure the starting puzzle has at least one "
"region of each colour, so that this is always possible!) "
"\n"
"If you need to clear a region, you can drag from an empty region, or "
"from the puzzle boundary if there are no empty regions left. "
"\n"
"Dragging a colour using the _right_ mouse button will stipple the "
"region in that colour, which you can use as a note to yourself that "
"you think the region _might_ be that colour. A region can contain "
"stipples in multiple colours at once. (This is often useful at the "
"harder difficulty levels.) "
"\n"
"You can also use the cursor keys to move around the map: the colour "
"of the cursor indicates the position of the colour you would drag "
"(which is not obvious if you're on a region's boundary, since it "
"depends on the direction from which you approached the boundary). "
"Pressing the return key starts a drag of that colour, as above, "
"which you control with the cursor keys; pressing the return key "
"again finishes the drag. The space bar can be used similarly to "
"create a stippled region. Double-pressing the return key (without "
"moving the cursor) will clear the region, as a drag from an empty "
"region does: this is useful with the cursor mode if you have filled "
"the entire map in but need to correct the layout. "
"\n"
"If you press L during play, the game will toggle display of a number "
"in each region of the map. This is useful if you want to discuss a "
"particular puzzle instance with a friend - having an unambiguous "
"name for each region is much easier than trying to refer to them all "
"by names such as `the one down and right of the brown one on the top "
"border'. "

"the colour of some regions. However, it will always be possible "
"without having to guess or backtrack. "
"\n"
"In `Unreasonable' mode, the program will feel free to generate "
"puzzles which are as hard as it can possibly make them: the "
"only constraint is that they should still have a unique "
"solution. Solving Unreasonable puzzles may require guessing and "

"#Chapter 23: Loopy "
"\n"
"You are given a grid of dots, marked with yellow lines to indicate "
"which dots you are allowed to connect directly together. Your aim is "
"to use some subset of those yellow lines to draw a single unbroken "
"loop from dot to dot within the grid. "
"\n"
"Some of the spaces between the lines contain numbers. These numbers "
"indicate how many of the lines around that space form part of the "
"loop. The loop you draw must correctly satisfy all of these clues to "
"be considered a correct solution. "

"In the default mode, the dots are arranged in a grid of squares; "
"however, you can also play on triangular or hexagonal grids, or even "
"more exotic ones. "
"\n"

"#Chapter 24: Inertia "
"\n"
"You are a small green ball sitting in a grid full of obstacles. Your "
"aim is to collect all the gems without running into any mines. "
"\n"
"You can move the ball in any orthogonal _or diagonal_ direction. "
"Once the ball starts moving, it will continue until something stops "
"it. A wall directly in its path will stop it (but if it is moving "
"diagonally, it will move through a diagonal gap between two other "
"walls without stopping). Also, some of the squares are `stops'; when "
"the ball moves on to a stop, it will stop moving no matter what "
"direction it was going in. Gems do _not_ stop the ball; it picks "
"them up and keeps on going. "
"\n"
"Running into a mine is fatal. Even if you picked up the last gem in "
"the same move which then hit a mine, the game will count you as dead "
"rather than victorious. "
"\n"
"This game was originally implemented for Windows by Ben Olmstead "
"[11], who was kind enough to release his source code on request so "
"that it could be re-implemented for this collection. "
"\n"
"[11] http://xn13.com/ "
"\n"
"\n#24.1 Inertia controls "
"\n"
"You can move the ball in any of the eight directions using the "
"numeric keypad. Alternatively, if you click the left mouse button "
"on the grid, the ball will begin a move in the general direction of "
"where you clicked. "
"\n"
"If you use the `Solve' function on this game, the program will "
"compute a path through the grid which collects all the remaining "
"gems and returns to the current position. A hint arrow will appear "
"on the ball indicating the direction in which you should move to "
"begin on this path. If you then move in that direction, the arrow "
"will update to indicate the next direction on the path. You can "
"also press Space to automatically move in the direction of the hint "
"arrow. If you move in a different direction from the one shown "
"by the arrow, arrows will be shown only if the puzzle is still "
"solvable. "
"\n"
"All the actions described in section 2.1 are also available. In "
"particular, if you do run into a mine and die, you can use the Undo "
"function and resume playing from before the fatal move. The game "

"You have a grid of squares, some of which contain trees. Your aim is "
"to place tents in some of the remaining squares, in such a way that "
"the following conditions are met: "
"\n"
"- There are exactly as many tents as trees. "
"\n"
"- The tents and trees can be matched up in such a way that each "
"tent is directly adjacent (horizontally or vertically, but not "

"square will clear it. "
"\n"
"If you _drag_ with the right button along a row or column, every "
"blank square in the region you cover will be turned green, and no "
"other squares will be affected. (This is useful for clearing the "
"remainder of a row once you have placed all its tents.) "
"\n"
"You can also use the cursor keys to move around the grid. Pressing "
"the return key over an empty square will place a tent, and pressing "
"the space bar over an empty square will colour it green; either key "

"#Chapter 26: Bridges "
"\n"
"You have a set of islands distributed across the playing area. "
"Each island contains a number. Your aim is to connect the islands "
"together with bridges, in such a way that: "
"\n"
"- Bridges run horizontally or vertically. "
"\n"
"- The number of bridges terminating at any island is equal to the "
"number written in that island. "
"\n"
"- Two bridges may run in parallel between the same two islands, "
"but no more than two may do so. "
"\n"
"- No bridge crosses another bridge. "
"\n"
"- All the islands are connected together. "
"\n"
"There are some configurable alternative modes, which involve "
"changing the parallel-bridge limit to something other than 2, and "
"introducing the additional constraint that no sequence of bridges "
"may form a loop from one island back to the same island. The rules "
"stated above are the default ones. "
"\n"
"Credit for this puzzle goes to Nikoli [12]. "
"\n"
"Bridges was contributed to this collection by James Harvey. "
"\n"
"[12] http://www.nikoli.co.jp/en/puzzles/hashiwokakero.html (beware "
"of Flash) "
"\n"
"\n#26.1 Bridges controls "
"\n"
"To place a bridge between two islands, click the mouse down on one "
"island and drag it towards the other. You do not need to drag all "
"the way to the other island; you only need to move the mouse far "
"enough for the intended bridge direction to be unambiguous. (So you "
"can keep the mouse near the starting island and conveniently throw "
"bridges out from it in many directions.) "
"\n"
"Doing this again when a bridge is already present will add another "
"parallel bridge. If there are already as many bridges between the "
"two islands as permitted by the current game rules (i.e. two by "
"default), the same dragging action will remove all of them. "
"\n"
"If you want to remind yourself that two islands definitely _do not_ "
"have a bridge between them, you can right-drag between them in the "
"same way to draw a `non-bridge' marker. "
"\n"
"If you think you have finished with an island (i.e. you have placed "
"all its bridges and are confident that they are in the right "
"places), you can mark the island as finished by left-clicking on it. "
"This will highlight it and all the bridges connected to it, and you "
"will be prevented from accidentally modifying any of those bridges "
"in future. Left-clicking again on a highlighted island will unmark "
"it and restore your ability to modify it. "
"\n"
"You can also use the cursor keys to move around the grid: if "
"possible the cursor will always move orthogonally, otherwise it "
"will move towards the nearest island to the indicated direction. "
"Holding Control and pressing a cursor key will lay a bridge in that "
"direction (if available); Shift and a cursor key will lay a `non-\n"
"bridge' marker. Pressing the return key followed by a cursor key "
"will also lay a bridge in that direction. "
"\n"
"You can mark an island as finished by pressing the space bar or by "
"pressing the return key twice. "
"\n"
"By pressing a number key, you can jump to the nearest island with "
"that number. Letters `a', ..., `f' count as 10, ..., 15 and `0' as "
"16. "
"\n"
"Violations of the puzzle rules will be marked in red: "
"\n"
"- An island with too many bridges will be highlighted in red. "
"\n"
"- An island with too few bridges will be highlighted in red if it "
"is definitely an error (as opposed to merely not being finished "
"yet): if adding enough bridges would involve having to cross "
"another bridge or remove a non-bridge marker, or if the island "
"has been highlighted as complete. "
"\n"
"- A group of islands and bridges may be highlighted in red if it "
"is a closed subset of the puzzle with no way to connect it to "
"the rest of the islands. For example, if you directly connect "
"two 1s together with a bridge and they are not the only two "
"islands on the grid, they will light up red to indicate that "
"such a group cannot be contained in any valid solution. "
"\n"
"- If you have selected the (non-default) option to disallow loops "
"in the solution, a group of bridges which forms a loop will be "
"highlighted. "

"\n"
"Gives a rough percentage of islands the generator will try and "
"lay before finishing the puzzle. Certain layouts will not manage "
"to lay enough islands; this is an upper bound. "
"\n"
"_Expansion factor (%age)_ "
"\n"
"The grid generator works by picking an existing island at random "
"(after first creating an initial island somewhere). It then "
"decides on a direction (at random), and then works out how far "
"it could extend before creating another island. This parameter "
"determines how likely it is to extend as far as it can, rather "
"than choosing somewhere closer. "
"\n"
"High expansion factors usually mean easier puzzles with fewer "
"possible islands; low expansion factors can create lots of "
"tightly-packed islands. "

"#Chapter 27: Unequal "
"\n"
"You have a square grid; each square may contain a digit from 1 to "
"the size of the grid, and some squares have clue signs between them. "
"Your aim is to fully populate the grid with numbers such that: "
"\n"
"- Each row contains only one occurrence of each digit "
"\n"
"- Each column contains only one occurrence of each digit "
"\n"
"- All the clue signs are satisfied. "
"\n"
"There are two modes for this game, `Unequal' and `Adjacent'. "
"\n"
"In `Unequal' mode, the clue signs are greater-than symbols "
"indicating one square's value is greater than its neighbour's. In "
"this mode not all clues may be visible, particularly at higher "
"difficulty levels. "
"\n"
"In `Adjacent' mode, the clue signs are bars indicating one square's "
"value is numerically adjacent (i.e. one higher or one lower) than "
"its neighbour. In this mode all clues are always visible: absence of "
"a bar thus means that a square's value is definitely not numerically "
"adjacent to that neighbour's. "
"\n"
"In `Trivial' difficulty level (available via the `Custom' game type "
"selector), there are no greater-than signs in `Unequal' mode; the "
"puzzle is to solve the Latin square only. "
"\n"
"At the time of writing, the `Unequal' mode of this puzzle is "
"appearing in the Guardian weekly under the name `Futoshiki'. "
"\n"
"Unequal was contributed to this collection by James Harvey. "
"\n"
"\n#27.1 Unequal controls "
"\n"
"Unequal shares much of its control system with Solo. "
"\n"
"To play Unequal, simply click the mouse in any empty square and then "
"type a digit or letter on the keyboard to fill that square. If you "
"make a mistake, click the mouse in the incorrect square and press "
"Space to clear it again (or use the Undo feature). "
"\n"
"If you _right_-click in a square and then type a number, that "
"number will be entered in the square as a `pencil mark'. You can "
"have pencil marks for multiple numbers in the same square. Squares "
"containing filled-in numbers cannot also contain pencil marks. "
"\n"
"The game pays no attention to pencil marks, so exactly what you "
"use them for is up to you: you can use them as reminders that a "
"particular square needs to be re-examined once you know more about "
"a particular number, or you can use them as lists of the possible "
"numbers in a given square, or anything else you feel like. "
"\n"
"To erase a single pencil mark, right-click in the square and type "
"the same number again. "
"\n"
"All pencil marks in a square are erased when you left-click and type "
"a number, or when you left-click and press space. Right-clicking and "
"pressing space will also erase pencil marks. "
"\n"
"As for Solo, the cursor keys can be used in conjunction with the "
"digit keys to set numbers or pencil marks. You can also use the `M' "
"key to auto-fill every numeric hint, ready for removal as required, "
"or the `H' key to do the same but also to remove all obvious hints. "
"\n"
"Alternatively, use the cursor keys to move the mark around the grid. "
"Pressing the return key toggles the mark (from a normal mark to a "
"pencil mark), and typing a number in is entered in the square in the "
"appropriate way; typing in a 0 or using the space bar will clear a "
"filled square. "
"\n"
"Left-clicking a clue will mark it as done (grey it out), or unmark "
"it if it is already marked. Holding Control or Shift and pressing "
"an arrow key likewise marks any clue adjacent to the cursor in the "
"given direction. "

"\n"
"You have a rectangular grid containing a number of dots. Your aim is "
"to draw edges along the grid lines which divide the rectangle into "
"regions in such a way that every region is 180-degree rotationally "
"symmetric, and contains exactly one dot which is located at its "
"centre of symmetry. "
"\n"
"This puzzle was invented by Nikoli [13], under the name `Tentai "
"Show'; its name is commonly translated into English as `Spiral "
"Galaxies'. "
"\n"
"Galaxies was contributed to this collection by James Harvey. "

"\n"
"\n#28.1 Galaxies controls "

"Left-click on any grid line to draw an edge if there isn't one "
"already, or to remove one if there is. When you create a valid "
"region (one which is closed, contains exactly one dot, is 180-degree "
"symmetric about that dot, and contains no extraneous edges inside "
"it) it will be highlighted automatically; so your aim is to have the "
"whole grid highlighted in that way. "
"\n"
"During solving, you might know that a particular grid square belongs "
"to a specific dot, but not be sure of where the edges go and which "
"other squares are connected to the dot. In order to mark this so you "
"don't forget, you can right-click on the dot and drag, which will "
"create an arrow marker pointing at the dot. Drop that in a square of "
"your choice and it will remind you which dot it's associated with. "
"You can also right-click on existing arrows to pick them up and move "
"them, or destroy them by dropping them off the edge of the grid. "
"(Also, if you're not sure which dot an arrow is pointing at, you can "
"pick it up and move it around to make it clearer. It will swivel "
"constantly as you drag it, to stay pointed at its parent dot.) "
"\n"
"You can also use the cursor keys to move around the grid squares and "
"lines. Pressing the return key when over a grid line will draw or "
"clear its edge, as above. Pressing the return key when over a dot "
"will pick up an arrow, to be dropped the next time the return key "
"is pressed; this can also be used to move existing arrows around, "
"removing them by dropping them on a dot or another arrow. "

"#Chapter 30: Keen "
"\n"
"You have a square grid; each square may contain a digit from 1 to "

"shape and size, with arithmetic clues written in them. Your aim is "
"to fully populate the grid with digits such that: "
"\n"
"- Each row contains only one occurrence of each digit "
"\n"
"- Each column contains only one occurrence of each digit "
"\n"
"- The digits in each block can be combined to form the number "
"stated in the clue, using the arithmetic operation given in the "
"clue. That is: "
"\n"
"- An addition clue means that the sum of the digits in the "
"block must be the given number. For example, `15+' means the "
"contents of the block adds up to fifteen. "
"\n"
"- A multiplication clue (e.g. `60*'), similarly, means that "
"the product of the digits in the block must be the given "
"number. "
"\n"
"- A subtraction clue will always be written in a block of "
"size two, and it means that one of the digits in the block "
"is greater than the other by the given amount. For example, "
"`2-' means that one of the digits in the block is 2 more "
"than the other, or equivalently that one digit minus the "
"other one is 2. The two digits could be either way round, "
"though. "
"\n"
"- A division clue (e.g. `3/'), similarly, is always in a block "
"of size two and means that one digit divided by the other is "
"equal to the given amount. "
"\n"
"Note that a block may contain the same digit more than once "
"(provided the identical ones are not in the same row and "

"contains an arrow, and some squares also contain numbers. Your job "
"is to connect the squares to form a continuous list of numbers "
"starting at 1 and linked in the direction of the arrows - so the "
"arrow inside the square with the number 1 will point to the square "
"containing the number 2, which will point to the square containing "
"the number 3, etc. Each square can be any distance away from the "
"previous one, as long as it is somewhere in the direction of the "
"arrow. "
"\n"
"By convention the first and last numbers are shown; one or more "
"interim numbers may also appear at the beginning. "
"\n"
"Credit for this puzzle goes to Janko [17], who call it `Pfeilpfad' "

"To play Signpost, you connect squares together by dragging from "
"one square to another, indicating that they are adjacent in the "
"sequence. Drag with the left button from a square to its successor, "
"or with the right button from a square to its predecessor. "
"\n"
"If you connect together two squares in this way and one of them has "
"a number in it, the appropriate number will appear in the other "
"square. If you connect two non-numbered squares, they will be "
"assigned temporary algebraic labels: on the first occasion, they "
"will be labelled `a' and `a+1', and then `b' and `b+1', and so on. "
"Connecting more squares on to the ends of such a chain will cause "
"them all to be labelled with the same letter. "
"\n"
"When you left-click or right-click in a square, the legal squares to "
"connect it to will be shown. "
"\n"
"The arrow in each square starts off black, and goes grey once you "
"connect the square to its successor. Also, each square which needs "
"a predecessor has a small dot in the bottom left corner, which "
"vanishes once you link a square to it. So your aim is always to "
"connect a square with a black arrow to a square with a dot. "
"\n"
"To remove any links for a particular square (both incoming and "
"outgoing), left-drag it off the grid. To remove a whole chain, "
"right-drag any square in the chain off the grid. "
"\n"
"You can also use the cursor keys to move around the grid squares "
"and lines. Pressing the return key when over a square starts a link "
"operation, and pressing the return key again over a square will "
"finish the link, if allowable. Pressing the space bar over a square "
"will show the other squares pointing to it, and allow you to form a "
"backward link, and pressing the space bar again cancels this. "

"#Chapter 35: Range "
"\n"
"You have a grid of squares; some squares contain numbers. Your job "

"- no square with a number is coloured black. "

"- for any two white squares, there is a path between them using "

"number of white squares reachable from that square going in a "
"straight line in any horizontal or vertical direction until "
"hitting a wall or a black square; the square with the number is "
"included in the total (once). "
"\n"
"For instance, a square containing the number one must have four "

"lines form a single closed loop. In the resulting grid, some of the "
"squares that the loop passes through will contain corners, and some "
"will be straight horizontal or vertical lines. (And some squares can "
"be completely empty - the loop doesn't have to pass through every "
"square.) "
"\n"
"Some of the squares contain black and white circles, which are clues "
"that the loop must satisfy. "
"\n"
"A black circle in a square indicates that that square is a corner, "
"but neither of the squares adjacent to it in the loop is also a "
"corner. "
"\n"
"A white circle indicates that the square is a straight edge, but _at "

"#Chapter 39: Flood "
"\n"
"You are given a grid of squares, coloured at random in multiple "
"colours. In each move, you can flood-fill the top left square in a "
"colour of your choice (i.e. every square reachable from the starting "
"square by an orthogonally connected path of squares all the same "
"colour will be filled in the new colour). As you do this, more and "
"more of the grid becomes connected to the starting square. "
"\n"
"Your aim is to make the whole grid the same colour, in as few moves "
"as possible. The game will set a limit on the number of moves, based "
"on running its own internal solver. You win if you can make the "
"whole grid the same colour in that many moves or fewer. "
"\n"
"I saw this game (with a fixed grid size, fixed number of colours, "
"and fixed move limit) at http://floodit.appspot.com (no longer "
"accessible). "
"\n"
"\n#39.1 Flood controls "
"\n"
"To play Flood, click the mouse in a square. The top left corner and "
"everything connected to it will be flood-filled with the colour of "
"the square you clicked. Clicking a square the same colour as the top "
"left corner has no effect, and therefore does not count as a move. "
"\n"
"You can also use the cursor keys to move a cursor (outline black "
"square) around the grid. Pressing the return key will fill the top "
"left corner in the colour of the square under the cursor. "
"\n"
"(All the actions described in section 2.1 are also available.) "

"\n"
"Controls the difficulty of the puzzle, by increasing the move "
"limit. In each new grid, Flood will run an internal solver to "
"generate its own solution, and then the value in this field "
"will be added to the length of Flood's solution to generate the "
"game's move limit. So a value of 0 requires you to be just as "
"efficient as Flood's automated solver, and a larger value makes "
"it easier. "
"\n"
"(Note that Flood's internal solver will not necessarily find the "
"shortest possible solution, though I believe it's pretty close. "
"For a real challenge, set this value to 0 and then try to solve "
"a grid in _strictly fewer_ moves than the limit you're given!) "

"#Chapter 40: Tracks "
"\n"
"You are given a grid of squares, some of which are filled with train "
"tracks. You need to complete the track from A to B so that the "
"rows and columns contain the same number of track segments as are "
"indicated in the clues to the top and right of the grid. "
"\n"
"There are only straight and 90 degree curved rails, and the track "
"may not cross itself. "
"\n"
"Tracks was contributed to this collection by James Harvey. "
"\n"
"\n#40.1 Tracks controls "
"\n"
"Left-clicking on an edge between two squares adds a track segment "
"between the two squares. Right-clicking on an edge adds a cross on "
"the edge, indicating no track is possible there. "
"\n"
"Left-clicking in a square adds a colour indicator showing that "
"you know the square must contain a track, even if you don't know "
"which edges it crosses yet. Right-clicking in a square adds a cross "
"indicating it contains no track segment. "
"\n"
"Left- or right-dragging between squares allows you to lay a straight "
"line of is-track or is-not-track indicators, useful for filling in "
"rows or columns to match the clue. "
"\n"
"(All the actions described in section 2.1 are also available.) "

"\n"
"Controls whether the Tracks game generation permits two adjacent "
"rows or columns to have a 1 clue, or permits the row or column "
"of the track's endpoint to have a 1 clue. By default this is "
"not permitted, to avoid long straight boring segments of track "
"and make the games more twiddly and interesting. If you want to "
"restore the possibility, turn this option off. "
"\n"
"#Chapter 41: Palisade "
"\n"
"You're given a grid of squares, some of which contain numbers. Your "
"goal is to subdivide the grid into contiguous regions, all of the "
"same (given) size, such that each square containing a number is "
"adjacent to exactly that many edges (including those between the "
"inside and the outside of the grid). "
